How does it look like and can it be achieved?<n><n>### Response:<n>		There is no such thing as a political center, although some people claim there is such a thing as a virtual one, so this task is to answer the question "how does a political center look like and can it actually be achieved?". <n><n>According to this definition, a center can be formed by an entity that is both large and powerful enough to dominate the discourse surrounding it.  That entity would need to have at most a million people following it on Twitter and influence the direction of public policy.  The powerful entity needs to have at minimum a majority in power and the means to realize this goal.<n>Certainly there could be some group of people who would be lukewarm to the idea of centralized power, but there would need to be widespread agreement that centralized power is something that should be pursued with very heavy hand.  To achieve this, there also needs to be a significant amount of money spent on influencing public opinion. It has to be a very expensive project, and while some resources can be made available for this, there also needs be a large amount of money invested in polling place design, field staffers, data and Internet infrastructure needed to support the efforts, and perhaps most importantly, a presidential candidate has to be on the minds of many large numbers of people across

To achieve this, they use a variety of cruel means to get to Berserk: they force him to drink their blood, eat his enemies, inject drugs that make him insane, or simply kick and beat him.

Bootstrapping enables the model to gradually become more aware of the idiosyncrasies of the target corpus. In this paper we describe the main components of the toolkit as well as experimental results stemming from both automatic and manual evaluation. We release DEFEXT as open source along with the necessary files to run it in any Unix machine. We also provide access to training and test data for immediate use.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Definitely I can do that.

Next, find all edges that v overlapped into adjacent neighbours of A: “A(y)=y+2”; A is a pair of two-dimensional vertices. We want to find all neighbours of A that are overlapped by both A and y. Finally, find the maximum common neighbours (‘M_{n+1})/M_{n}') of A; this is the total neighbourhood space of all vertices ordered along the adjacency space of all edges along A. We want to find the intersection points of all these adjacency spaces. To do this, we intersect each edge v on all the vertices z, where z is either at or at right hand corner of the adjacency space.

Three dimensional microstructure of the particles reveals that there are many pores contained in, particularly the coal combustion fly particles which may be possible virus carrier. The particles can transport over long distance and cause long-range infections due to its light weight. We suggest a mode which is droplet combining with aerosol mode. By this mode the transmission of global and pandemic influenzas and infection between inland avian far from population and poultry or human living in cities along coast may be explained.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The research paper you are working on has been titled "Aschelozavirus Transmission in the Atmospheric Environment Using High-Speed Electron Microscopic Transmission X-ray Microscopy." Your task is to generate a title for the research paper that appropriately describes the paper as "Airborne Influenza Pandemic." Under 100 words is a reasonable title length.

Blood samples were obtained before, and at 2 and 5 min after the administration of the neuromuscular blocker. The twitch response to 0.15 Hz was also evaluated. None of the 10 patients receiving vecuronium had a significant increase in plasma histamine concentration. In two of the 10 children receiving atracurium, the plasma histamine concentration increased markedly, but without any apparent clinical manifestations. Recovery of neuromuscular function (to 95% twitch height) after vecuronium 0.12 mg kg-1 was faster than after atracurium 0.6 mg kg-1 (P less than 0.02).<n><n>### Response:<n>		The central focus of this paper is on the neuromuscular blocking potential of atracurium versus vecuronium, and the results of this study suggest that treatment with either agent improves clinical recovery of neuromuscular activity following a single dose of halothane.

Paul tells Titus to go buy them a cow and they immediately reply "Woe from us!" (Proverbs 20:14)   This is an allusion to the offering offered by the demons to the people (vv. 14–15).  Satan tempted Eve and committed original sin, so the offering from the demons is meant to bring joy to the people.

A solid renal lesion which is identified in a patient with a history of pulmonary carcinoma should raise the suspicion of renal metastases, especially if computed tomography of the mass demonstrates relative homogeneity and minimal enhancement. More frequent use of the abdominal CT scan in staging patients with lung cancer will render metastatic carcinoma from lung to kidney a more frequent ante mortem diagnosis.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Cases of clinically manifest solitary and unilateral renal lesions are presented.

Under 100 words is a good title length.<n><n>### Input:<n>Despite intensive ongoing research, key aspects of the spatial-temporal evolution of the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in Great Britain (GB) remain unexplained. Here we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models. We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected. We estimate how transmission parameters varied through time, highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species. Predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of GB are presented for the fitted models.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The research paper you are working on has a heading of "FMD: A Mystery Unraveled".

First, organisms such as e.g. whales have very complex brain architectures and hence lack the capacity for the brain to efficiently process information in the water column at the surface. Second, the DNA of certain animals, e.g. crocodiles and whales, contains genetic material that is incapable of producing proteins in the water column. Thus, the eukaryotic organisms develop at a slower rate than their aquatic ancestors. Third and finally, evolution has a way to quickly produce non-living tissue at a rapid rate, e.g. muscle and hair. These are often passed down through the maternal lineage, which in turn pass the non-living material down the maternal line via the placenta. Thus, the potential for non-living tissue to form in the water column is lost during this process.

This dynamic structure physically connects neighboring epithelial cells, couples intercellular adhesive contacts to the cytoskeleton, and helps define each cell's apical-basal axis. Together these activities coordinate the form, polarity, and function of all cells in an epithelium. Several molecules regulate AJ formation and integrity, including Rho family GTPases and Par polarity proteins. However, only recently, with the development of live-cell imaging, has the extent to which E-cadherin is actively turned over at junctions begun to be appreciated. This turnover contributes to junction formation and to the maintenance of epithelial integrity during tissue homeostasis and remodeling.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Title is Under thirty words

Mapping such syntactic variants into semantic concepts that can be understood by robots is challenging due to the high flexibility of natural language expressions. To tackle this problem, we collect robotic commands for navigation and manipulation tasks using crowdsourcing. We further define a robot language and use a generative machine translation model to translate robotic commands from natural language to robot language. The main purpose of this paper is to simulate the interaction process between human and robots using crowdsourcing platforms, and investigate the possibility of translating natural language to robot language with paraphrases.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Under fifteen words

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We propose zoneout, a novel method for regularizing RNNs. At each timestep, zoneout stochastically forces some hidden units to maintain their previous values. Like dropout, zoneout uses random noise to train a pseudo-ensemble, improving generalization. But by preserving instead of dropping hidden units, gradient information and state information are more readily propagated through time, as in feedforward stochastic depth networks. We perform an empirical investigation of various RNN regularizers, and find encouraging results: zoneout gives significant performance improvements across tasks, yielding state-ofthe-art results in character-level language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset and competitive results on word-level Penn Treebank and permuted sequential MNIST classification tasks.<n><n>### Response:<n>		zoneout  reduces the hidden unit cost of regularizers.

To make encoder-decoder models more flexible, attention mechanism was introduced to machine translation and also other tasks like speech recognition and image captioning. We observe that the quality of translation by attention-based encoder-decoder can be significantly damaged when the alignment is incorrect. We attribute these problems to the lack of distortion and fertility models. Aiming to resolve these problems, we propose new variations of attention-based encoderdecoder and compare them with other models on machine translation. Our proposed method achieved an improvement of 2 BLEU points over the original attentionbased encoder-decoder.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Neural machine translations have shown very promising results lately, but many NMT models follow the encoding-decoder framework instead.

The key derivation problem, or MD5, is divided up into a set of 32 distinct steps with 64 different block cipher modes ("polynomial"), for a total of 128 bits (256 bits per key), in order to compute the Diffie-Hellmann key. The Diffie-Hellman public key cryptosystem was developed by two teams, one from Germany and one from the United States, in collaboration with academic researchers from around the world and with the participation of extensive hardware and software development resources. For the MD5 challenge, two public/private key pairs were generated, using public key pairings derived from public keys of known public key cryptosystems. The public keys of known public-key cryptosystems and key pairings corresponding to known public key cryptosums were combined in a supersized public key cryptosystem known as OpenSSL. For the MD5 attack, the same set of 128-bit public keys and key pairings were combined in a second supersized key cryptosystem known by Bouncy Castle

More specifically, we propose a skip-thought neighbor model to consider the adjacent sentences as a neighborhood. We train our skip-thought neighbor model on a large corpus with continuous sentences, and then evaluate the trained model on 7 tasks, which include semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, and classification benchmarks. Both quantitative comparison and qualitative investigation are conducted. We empirically show that, our skip-thought neighbor model performs as well as the skip-thought model on evaluation tasks. In addition, we found that, incorporating an autoencoder path in our model didn’t aid our model to perform better, while it hurts the performance of the skip-thought model.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We study the proposed skip-thought model proposed By Kiros et al. <n><n>More specifically, we propose a model to consider the adjacent sentence as a neighborhood.<n><n>We train our model on a large corpus of continuous sentences, and then compare it to get an evaluation score.<n><n>Our model does not perform as well as the skip model when it comes to semantic relatedness, paraphrasing detection, and classification.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Recently deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to learn speaker features. However, the quality of the learned features is not sufficiently good, so a complex back-end model, either neural or probabilistic, has to be used to address the residual uncertainty when applied to speaker verification, just as with raw features. This paper presents a convolutional timedelay deep neural network structure (CT-DNN) for speaker feature learning. Our experimental results on the Fisher database demonstrated that this CT-DNN can produce highquality speaker features: even with a single feature (0.3 seconds including the context), the EER can be as low as 7.68%. This effectively confirmed that the speaker trait is largely a deterministic short-time property rather than a long-time distributional pattern, and therefore can be extracted from just dozens of frames.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Recently deep neural network  DNN have been used to learn the speaker features.
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.<n><n>### Input:<n>Abstract: Random-dot stereograms were found to be capable of producing fusional vergence amplitudes in the absence of monocular contours. These vergence amplitudes are not an artefact of monocular contours provided by the target borders or test instrument and are comparable in range to vergence amplitudes measured clinically with second degree fusion targets in an amblyoscope. We conclude that diplopia of monocularly recognisable contours is not necessary for producing fusional vergence amplitudes.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Random-dot stereograms were able to produce fusional vergence amplitude in the absence of monophonic contours.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Matrix factorization (MF) and Autoencoder (AE) are among the most successful approaches of unsupervised learning. While MF based models have been extensively exploited in the graph modeling and link prediction literature, the AE family has not gained much attention. In this paper we investigate both MF and AE’s application to the link prediction problem in sparse graphs. We show the connection between AE and MF from the perspective of multiview learning, and further propose MF+AE: a model training MF and AE jointly with shared parameters. We apply dropout to training both the MF and AE parts, and show that it can significantly prevent overfitting by acting as an adaptive regularization. We conduct experiments on six real world sparse graph datasets, and show that MF+AE consistently outperforms the competing methods, especially on datasets that demonstrate strong non-cohesive structures.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The focus is on headlines for this paper. The type of headlines you can generate depends on the specific dataset and the type of problem you are trying to solve.

To this, I can only say that the opposite is true.  Iran, as a state, has a long and distinguished history of scientific discovery, cosmology, and mathematics - all things we take for granted as normal in a modern state. However, in many quarters,  even within its own borders, people have long held irrational and misguided expectations about Iran.   Prominent examples include:<n>* believing that only Iran possesses nuclear weapons and the lack of any other capabilities<n>* concluding that all previous nuclear weapons have been for peaceful purposes only and that Iran is now a world state with no further use for non-peaceful means<n>* concluding that all countries that support the regime, such as the West and its regional allies, have ceased to exist as threats to regional stability and security and therefore Iran is a non-threat<n>Additionally, in countries like Yemen and Syria, which are historically very close to Iran, people often interpret changing media and public rhetoric - such as newly elected President Trump's frequent assertions that he or she can "change" Iran to "win the nuclear war" even as he utters incommunicado threats against Iran's government.

Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>T cell activation is predicated on the interaction between the T cell receptor and peptide-major histocompatibility (pMHC) ligands. The factors that determine the stimulatory potency of a pMHC molecule remain unclear. We describe results showing that a peptide exhibiting many hallmarks of a weak agonist stimulates T cells to proliferate more than the wild-type agonist ligand. An in silico approach suggested that the inability to form the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) could underlie the increased proliferation. This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed that enhancing cSMAC formation reduced stimulatory capacity of the weak peptide. Our studies highlight the fact that a complex interplay of factors determines the quality of a T cell antigen.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Article title is Under thirty words.

We compiled several relevant and appropriate requirement quality attributes and sentence rules from previous literatures and adopt it to come out with a set of ambiguity attributes that most suit Malay words. The extracted Malay ambiguous words (potential) are then being mapped onto the constructed ambiguity attributes to confirm their vagueness. The list is then verified by Malay linguist experts. This paper aims to identify a list of potential ambiguous words in Malay as an attempt to assist writers to avoid using the vague words while documenting Malay Requirement Specification as well as to any other related Malay documentation. The result of this study is a list of 120 potential ambiguous Malay words that could act as guidelines in writing Malay sentences.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Malay words are commonly used in Malay documentation such as Requirement Specifications.

The fundamental reason is the difficulty of backpropagation through discrete random variables combined with the inherent instability of the GAN training objective. To address these problems, we propose Maximum-Likelihood Augmented Discrete Generative Adversarial Networks. Instead of directly optimizing the GAN objective, we derive a novel and low-variance objective using the discriminator’s output that follows corresponds to the log-likelihood. Compared with the original, the new objective is proved to be consistent in theory and beneficial in practice. The experimental results on various discrete datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The proposed maximum-likelihood augmented discrete generative adversarial networks approach to backpropagation through continuous distributions is proven effective in training natural language models.

During this, the scenes between the characters continue unabatedly. There is no "hurt" in any of these scenes. The scenes keep going on because characters in love with each other keep on loving each other and having sex. This is a classic Bollywood plot!

Bush, flew into a surprise visit to deliver a pro-government speech in the nation's capital on a five-hundred mile round trip from Texas, where he was vacationing during the summer. Bush's surprise visit to the capital was timed with the new administration's declaration that it was cracking down hard on the pro-government insurgents in the eastern province of iraq, which was seen as a signal of U.S. support for the government's efforts to retake control of vital oil fields in the country. The president's visit marked a significant escalation in efforts to retake control of these fields, which have been a source of persistent support for the insurgents in the eastern part of the country. Although the president made no mention of the fighting in the region during his remarks, his visit reinforced longstanding U.S. support to the government of national unity in its efforts to defeat the growing influence of foreign fighters in the region.... While most Arab countries have been supportive of the iraqi government, where the insurgents have made significant gains, the West has been slow to recognize their importance and has not responded as forcefully as countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, which have been providing military and intelligence support.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>State-space models are successfully used in many areas of science, engineering and economics to model time series and dynamical systems. We present a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning (i.e. state estimation and system identification) in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. We place a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, resulting in a flexible model able to capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efficient inference, we marginalize over the transition dynamics function and infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using specially tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution can be formulated analytically. Our approach preserves the full nonparametric expressivity of the model and can make use of sparse Gaussian processes to greatly reduce computational complexity.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The goal of this task is to generate a headline (title) for the text under under 15 words.

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a consistent increased risk for cardiovascular events in relation to both short- and long-term exposure to present-day concentrations of ambient particulate matter. Several plausible mechanistic pathways have been described, including enhanced coagulation/thrombosis, a propensity for arrhythmias, acute arterial vasoconstriction, systemic inflammatory responses, and the chronic promotion of atherosclerosis. The purpose of this statement is to provide healthcare professionals and regulatory agencies with a comprehensive review of the literature on air pollution and cardiovascular disease. In addition, the implications of these findings in relation to public health and regulatory policies are addressed. Practical recommendations for healthcare providers and their patients are outlined. In the final section, suggestions for future research are made to address a number of remaining scientific questions.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Air pollution is known to be a major contributor to premature death in humans. This is largely attributed to the fact that air pollution occurs in large quantities across the global landscape. A multitude of factors has been implicated in contributing to this problem, including increased risk for cardiovascular events, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and an increased likelihood of certain types of heart diseases. While there is much more research to be done, this topic is of significant public health concern.

No physical sign is useful in the diagnosis of this condition, which should be suspected on the basis of presenting symptoms and confirmed by electrodiagnosis using standard median nerve conduction tests.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The five clinical tests in common use to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome belong to a class of tests known as MRIs, which are independent, single-site examinations that use a standard nerve conduction test to diagnose the condition. While the single-site approach allows for testing of many areas of the body, it is prone to false positives, which means that the correct diagnosis cannot be determined based on the entire body. Thus, the focus of this paper is on the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome, which is to be based on symptoms and the presence of numbness or tingling in the digits.

The birth-weights of babies born to women with inflammatory bowel disease were marginally lower than those born to women in a control group matched for age and parity, but the difference was statistically significant only in women with Crohn's disease. In both disease groups there was a higher frequency of low haemoglobin levels in pregnancy than in the matched control groups. There were no statistically significant effects of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease on duration of pregnancy, mode of delivery or raised blood pressure and/or proteinuria. In the absence of a relapse, a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease should not influence obstetric management.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The study presented here provides the key focus of the study, which is on the possibility that both conditions could have a significant influence on pregnancy outcome. While the study did not find a causal effect of either disease on pregnancy outcome, it does suggest that the results do suggest that neither condition is completely useless for inducing a pregnancy.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you're given an ambiguous question (which can be answered in more than one way). Your task is to write a question that clarifies the given question in such a way that the generated question has one unique answer.<n><n>### Input:<n>How many jury members in a criminal trial?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Jury selection in a criminal trial is a highly politicized process, with both sides expressing their views on how the case should be decided. Many believe that juries are selected with an eye toward punishing the guilty, and that the punishment should follow the crime. This topic has come up in many criminal cases, and generally speaking, the answer given by the defense is that fewer jurors are involved.<n><n>The problem with this answer, however, is that there is no way to know for sure, and as the law requires the judge to make an award based on the evidence, this answer is inadvisable. Additionally, the defense would still need to prove three factors beyond a reasonable doubt, namely, that the juror was indifferent, that the juror conspired with the other members of the jury and that the prejudged juror was prejudiced against the defendant. This last factor is extremely difficult to prove. Given that the prejudged jurist was also a member of the opposing party, it is also extremely unlikely that this individual would not have similarly prejudged the defendant. Additionally, since it is hard to give multiple examples of people being prejudiced against the same defendant, it is even more unlikely that this person would have been active on the jury.<n><n>

The project, which has been dubbed the "Flexible Sideways Antenna for Mass Transportation," uses a curved, flat Earth antenna that couples with a specialized transmitting antenna specially developed for use on the California high-speed rail (California High-Speed Rail, or Caltrain), and allows the two to communicate with each other without any strain or interference from other components on the ground or inside the spacecraft. The new antenna is capable of receiving both high- and low-power signals, and is optimized for use in the very high-bandwidth applications for transmission and reception that Caltrain is currently experiencing," says lead researcher Jochen Steiner, who is corresponding author on the paper. "Although this technology has great potential for significantly reducing the strain and noise from long-distance radio transmissions, we must be careful not to over complicate the design, as this could cause the antenna to interfere with other components on the spacecraft, which could cause delays or cancellations." The Flexible Sid

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We present Deep Speaker, a neural speaker embedding system that maps utterances to a hypersphere where speaker similarity is measured by cosine similarity. The embeddings generated by Deep Speaker can be used for many tasks, including speaker identification, verification, and clustering. We experiment with ResCNN and GRU architectures to extract the acoustic features, then mean pool to produce utterance-level speaker embeddings, and train using triplet loss based on cosine similarity. Experiments on three distinct datasets suggest that Deep Speaker outperforms a DNN-based i-vector baseline. For example, Deep Speaker reduces the verification equal error rate by 50% (relatively) and improves the identification accuracy by 60% (relatively) on a text-independent dataset. We also present results that suggest adapting from a model trained with Mandarin can improve accuracy for English speaker recognition.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Deep Speaker maps utterances to a hyperplace in the text using acoustic features. You can use this to identify speakers based on similarities in the spoken words.

This systematic investigation of HBV stability and susceptibility to different antiseptics revealed that HBV infectivity was very stable, with a half-life of >22 days at 37°C. At 4°C, infectivity was barely reduced for up to 9 months. Different alcohols and commercially available hand antiseptics had a virucidal effect against HBV. We propose that very strict compliance with established hygienic guidelines should be mandatory to avoid and prevent HBV infections.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Hepatitosis B virus (HBV), commonly known as the 'HB virus', is a major public health menace and a significant number of public health reports have been submitted on its prevalence and potential effects on human health.

Previous research mainly focuses on producing a colored image to match the original one. However, since many colors share the same gray value, an input grayscale image could be diversely colored while maintaining its reality. In this paper, we design a novel solution for unsupervised diverse colorization. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative adversarial networks to model the distribution of real-world item colors, in which we develop a fully convolutional generator with multi-layer noise to enhance diversity, with multi-layer condition concatenation to maintain reality, and with stride 1 to keep spatial information. With such a novel network architecture, the model yields highly competitive performance on the open LSUN bedroom dataset. The Turing test of 80 humans further indicates our generated color schemes are highly convincible.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Under fifteen words

However, designing studies around the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology POR criteria can be methodologically challenging, as the new definition includes various POR subpopulations with diverse baseline characteristics and unknown clinical prognosis. When designing RCTs, potential result bias may be introduced if women from each subpopulation are not evenly allocated between intervention groups. In the case of small or moderate-size RCTs, a single-sequence randomization method may not ensure balanced allocation between groups. Stratified randomization methods provide an alternative methodological approach. Depending on the chosen methodology, patient characteristics and outcomes within each intervention group may be better reported according to relevant subpopulations.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Small or moderate-size Riots are more likely to report favorable outcomes according to subpopulation.

We clearly demonstrate that even on a well-explored dataset like MNIST, challenging training scenarios can be constructed under the proposed assessment framework for two separate yet equally important applications: i) more rigorous learning model comparison and ii) dataset adequacy evaluation. In addition, our findings not only promise a more complete identification of trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy and robustness but can also help researchers optimize their efforts in data collection by identifying the less robust and more challenging class labels.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We introduce a robustness metric derived From Source-Aware Lower and Upper Bounds Of Model Accuracy Even When Data Source L labels Are Not Exists.

The possible significance of these clinical and biological findings is discussed.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The authors describe a small number of diabetic retinopathy patients who had "soft exudates" either totally isolated or associated only with fewer than 10 microneurons. These observations suggest that, while cotton-wool spots are an early finding in diabetic retinaopathy, significant biological abnormalities may be related to hyperglycosylated haemolymph and mild increases in thronuclear generation, which could signal activation of the coagulopathy system.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.<n><n>### Input:<n>Abstract: Five children, aged 6 to 16 years, were tested for unilateral discrimination and interhemispheric transfer of tactile information as well as tactuomotor learning at various intervals before and after therapeutic callosotomy. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children. Bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms. The most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways. The relatively greater deficits observed in the older children, on the other hand, suggest that sensorimotor functions come to depend more extensively on contralateral pathways as the corpus callosum reaches functional maturity.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Baseline measurements revealed a significant deficit in the ability to perform tactile tasks in the younger children, compared to older children. These young children, who have not undergone surgical retraining, have impaired tactuomotor behavior and acquired unilateral discrimination.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task you're given a question and you have to paraphrase the question to create the output question while retaining the meaning of the original question.<n><n>### Input:<n>What's the layman explanation of Godel's incompleteness theorem?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Consider the statement that for every 2 prime p, there exist n such that p - 1 is equal to 2p. This is clearly not true; for any such case, there exists an integer p such that (2p-1)*2p is equal to 1. The statement also contains two other properties which are not true: 1/2 is irrational, which says that for every 2 p, there exists an integer n such that p - p is rational. The implication is that for every p such that p is rational, there is an integer p such that p - p - 1 is irrational. Exercising this insight, it follows that for every p such That p - p - 1, there exists an integer such that p < p - p and vice versa. The existence of such a non-empty range for p implies that for every p such p, there exists an infinitely many p such that p and p<p. This contradicts the statement's stated meaning.

Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Genes that are subject to genomic imprinting in mammals are preferentially expressed from a single parental allele. This imprinted expression of a small number of genes is crucial for normal development, as these genes often directly regulate fetal growth. Recent work has also demonstrated intricate roles for imprinted genes in the brain, with important consequences on behavior and neuronal function. Finally, new studies have revealed the importance of proper expression of specific imprinted genes in induced pluripotent stem cells and in adult stem cells. As we review here, these findings highlight the complex nature and developmental importance of imprinted genes.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Authoring a title for this article under thirty words will generate one paragraph of text.

Consider the following RSA public key ciphers:<n>2^k = 4<n>3^k = 8<n>5^k = 10<n>7^k = 13<n>However, for a question like the one you are asking, which uses the numbers 2, 5 and 7, the answer isn't 3, 5 or 7, it's 2. That's because there are 6 possible values of k that don't make sense as 3 in this case. Consider the following values of k:<n>2^10 = 4<n>2^9 = 6<n>3^9 = 7<n>5^9 = 10<n>7^9 = 13<n>However the answer for this question is 3, 5 and 7. So in this case, the correct answer is 5.

The model, parameterized by Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Processes, overcomes the limitations of previous generative models by allowing fast and accurate inference. We propose an efficient decoding algorithm based on particle filtering that can adapt the beam size to the uncertainty in the model while jointly predicting POS tags and parse trees. The UAS of the parser is on par with that of a greedy discriminative baseline. As a language model, it obtains better perplexity than a n-gram model by performing semi-supervised learning over a large unlabelled corpus. We show that the model is able to generate locally and syntactically coherent sentences, opening the door to further applications in language generation.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We propose a model that can generate locally and syntactical coherent sentences, opening the doors to further applications in language creation.

While finite-horizon DECPOMDPs have enjoyed significant success, progress remains slow for the infinite-horizon case mainly due to the inherent complexity of optimizing stochastic controllers representing agent policies. We present a promising new class of algorithms for the infinite-horizon case, which recasts the optimization problem as inference in a mixture of DBNs. An attractive feature of this approach is the straightforward adoption of existing inference techniques in DBNs for solving DEC-POMDPs and supporting richer representations such as factored or continuous states and actions. We also derive the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize the joint policy represented as DBNs. Experiments on benchmark domains show that EM compares favorably against the state-of-the-art solvers.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The aim of this task is to generate a headline (title) for the text given by the part of the article.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We develop a new model for Interactive Question Answering (IQA), using GatedRecurrent-Unit recurrent networks (GRUs) as encoders for statements and questions, and another GRU as a decoder for outputs. Distinct from previous work, our approach employs context-dependent word-level attention for more accurate statement representations and question-guided sentence-level attention for better context modeling. Employing these mechanisms, our model accurately understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a supplementary question for additional input. When available, user’s feedback is encoded and directly applied to update sentence-level attention to infer the answer. Extensive experiments on QA and IQA datasets demonstrate quantitatively the effectiveness of our model with significant improvement over conventional QA models.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The goal of this task is to generate a headline (title) for text that is under fifteen words.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>The AGM theory of belief revision has be­ come an important paradigm for investigat­ ing rational belief changes. Unfortunately, researchers working in this paradigm have re­ stricted much of their attention to rather sim­ ple representations of belief states, namely logically closed sets of propositional sen­ tences. In our opinion, this has resulted in a too abstract categorisation of belief change operations: expansion, revision, or contrac­ tion. Occasionally, in the AGM paradigm, also probabilistic belief changes have been considered, and it is widely accepted that the probabilistic version of expansion is con­ ditioning. However, we argue that it may be more correct to view conditioning and expan­ sion as two essentially different kinds of belief change, and that what we call constraining is a better candidate for being considered prob­ abilistic expansion.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The text you have generated includes the heading "The AGM theory of believe rewinding is an important paradigm for con­vergence theorisisim."

To close these notorious vehicles down would mean the difference between life and death for local residents. One solution is to close down some of the most dangerous vehicles, such as motor vehicles, dangerous bicycles and pick-up trucks. To combat air pollution, the city has embarked on the largest ever plan to close down all motor vehicles, including buses, trains, bicycles and trucks. The goal is to reduce traffic congestion, pollution and deaths caused by physical traffic congestion. The plan involves closing down primary and secondary road networks entirely, effectively shutting down all traffic except for essential vehicles, which will then be dropped off and picked up by specially adapted trucks. This enormous and drastic step will force local residents to endure dangerous detours and inconvenience their daily schedules.

While this theory is scientifically sound, the details make it hard to believe. At a high level, a black hole consumes all of its star's mass, leading to the accretion of material in the form of stars. These accretion disks eventually become so dense that they start to pull stars toward the black hole. This event, known as the Big Bang, is thought to have triggered the evolution of all things into stars. However, it is difficult to trace the exact cause of the star's death.

This is due to its limited supply, the fact that it's an alloy, and how it's processed.  The most common ways in which pewter is processed are blast furnaces, followed by an oven, followed by a kiln, and finally finishing with cleaning and polishing.   Pure pewter contains 93.5% copper, and while certain colors of copper are typically hexagonal or even octagonal, pewter is generally a solid color.  Additionally, pewter's high osmosis process produces cloudy colors which is an aesthetic concern.  There are even concerns that certain colors of copper are actually "bleached" which means their visual appearance is slightly off.  This last concern is very subjective, however, and is largely driven by "eye candy" when considering what colors are "bleached" and what aren't.  Additionally, any copper ore that leaves a kiln is typically treated with hydrogen to remove as much of the color as possible without compromising its purity (hence why the color bleached often comes through as the final product).

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We tackle the problem of inferring node labels in a partially labeled graph where each node in the graph has multiple label types and each label type has a large number of possible labels. Our primary example, and the focus of this paper, is the joint inference of label types such as hometown, current city, and employers, for users connected by a social network. Standard label propagation fails to consider the properties of the label types and the interactions between them. Our proposed method, called EDGEEXPLAIN, explicitly models these, while still enabling scalable inference under a distributed message-passing architecture. On a billion-node subset of the Facebook social network, EDGEEXPLAIN significantly outperforms label propagation for several label types, with lifts of up to 120% for recall@1 and 60% for recall@3.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Your task is to generate headline for this text.

The study included 30 healthy non-pregnant women and 90 healthy pregnant women equally distributed across the three trimesters. Two variables were investigated: the number of mononuclear cells in phagocytosis and the average number of bacteria per monocyte in phagocytosis. As pregnancy progressed a gradual and significant increase was found in the number of monocytes in phagocytosis and a significantly higher proportion of macrophages with six or more bacteria per phagocyte.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Pregnant women who are non-pregnant but are pregnant should be aware of the risks of getting Staphylococcus Epidermis in their bloodstream, and hence the need to avoid getting it during pregnancy.

This problem may be even worse for postgraduate students who are new to a field and may not know where to start. To address this problem, we have developed an online catalog of research papers where the papers have been automatically categorized by a topic model. The catalog contains 7719 papers from the proceedings of two artificial intelligence conferences from 2000 to 2015. Rather than the commonly used Latent Dirichlet Allocation, we use a recently proposed method called hierarchical latent tree analysis for topic modeling. The resulting topic model contains a hierarchy of topics so that users can browse the topics from the top level to the bottom level. The topic model contains a manageable number of general topics at the top level and allows thousands of fine-grained topics at the bottom level. It also can detect topics that have emerged recently.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The online catalog of research papers includes 7719 papers from the Proceedings of two artificial intelligence conferences between 2000 to 2015.

We have assessed HPRT mutants in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with connective tissue diseases who have been treated for long periods with cytotoxic drugs. The results from patients treated with cyclophosphamide were abnormal suggesting the presence of drug-induced mutations. The results from patients treated with chlorambucil or azathioprine did not differ from controls--either these drugs have not induced mutations or, more likely, the technique is not sufficiently sensitive to detect them. These possibilities are discussed. Specific mutations induced by cytotoxic drugs in patients with connective tissue diseases have not been previously recorded.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The research described here describes the in vivo detection of cells with mutations at the HPRT locus by their resistance to the harmful effects of thioguanine.

The type II prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas adaptive immune system has been shown to facilitate RNA-guided site-specific DNA cleavage. We engineered two different type II CRISPR/Cas systems and demonstrate that Cas9 nucleases can be directed by short RNAs to induce precise cleavage at endogenous genomic loci in human and mouse cells. Cas9 can also be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with minimal mutagenic activity. Lastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided nuclease technology.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Article title is Under thirty words.

While essential object detection ingredients such as features, classifiers, and proposal methods have been extensively researched surprisingly little work has aimed to systematically address NMS. The de-facto standard for NMS is based on greedy clustering with a fixed distance threshold, which forces to trade-off recall versus precision. We propose a convnet designed to perform NMS of a given set of detections. We report experiments on a synthetic setup, and results on crowded pedestrian detection scenes. Our approach overcomes the intrinsic limitations of greedy NMS, obtaining better recall and precision.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Under fifteen words

In obese individuals, adipose tissue releases increased amounts of non-esterified fatty acids, glycerol, hormones, pro-inflammatory cytokines and other factors that are involved in the development of insulin resistance. When insulin resistance is accompanied by dysfunction of pancreatic islet β-cells — the cells that release insulin — failure to control blood glucose levels results. Abnormalities in β-cell function are therefore critical in defining the risk and development of type 2 diabetes. This knowledge is fostering exploration of the molecular and genetic basis of the disease and new approaches to its treatment and prevention.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The scientific community is uncovering more about the molecular and genetic basis and causes of obesity each day.

In reality, before a new order can be put into production, a series of activities known as pre-production events need to be completed. In addition, in real production process, owing to various uncertainties, the daily production quantity of each order is not always as expected. In this research, by considering the pre-production events and the uncertainties in the daily production quantity, robust order scheduling problems in the fashion industry are investigated with the aid of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) called nondominated sorting adaptive differential evolution (NSJADE). The experimental results illustrate that it is of paramount importance to consider pre-production events in order scheduling problems in the fashion industry. We also unveil that the existence of the uncertainties in the daily production quantity heavily affects the order scheduling.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The existence of the uncertainties in daily production quantity heavily affects how the order scheduling problems in the Fashion industry are investigated.

We were unable to show any abnormality in the excretion of Zn, Mg or GAG. In 11 patients, a low level of urinary citrate was a significant feature that was associated in most cases with a urinary pH value above 6. Citrate concentration (per litre) and output (per 24 h) were found to be lower than in the controls in 19 and 33% respectively of the determinations. The overall ratio of average urinary citrate concentration in patients and controls was 0.56, a figure in agreement with previous data.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The excretion of four inhibitors that were studied in 20 normal controls is focused on one particular type of stone forming disorder, recurrent calcium stone formers.
