Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task you're given a question and you have to paraphrase the question to create the output question while retaining the meaning of the original question.<n><n>### Input:<n>Is there such a thing as a political center? How does it look like and can it be achieved?<n><n>### Response:<n>		The answer is a complicated question and lacks a clear definition. However, some examples provide us insight.<n>Most revolutions start when a new political center is established - or when "there is a dominant political ideology that is accepted as the best and only".[1][2] It usually consists of representatives of the previously dominant ideology and groups that hold them in power - typically governments, companies, unions and the ruling class. A political center is also usually established after a wide popular rejection of that ideology, typically by decisive riots, uprisings or civil wars. Usually, it does not take long for this center to be demolished. It usually takes a number of decades for this process to be complete and the center eventually becomes irrelevant or inaccessible for most people.
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given triplets. Each triplet is in the form of [subject, predicate, object]. Your task is to generate proper sentence that utilizes these triples. The objective is to construct a sentence that (a) captures the facts specified in the triples and (b) is a well-formed sentence easily understandable by a human. All triple values need not be used directly in the sentence as long as the facts are adequately captured.<n><n>### Input:<n>[['[TABLECONTEXT]', '[TITLE]', '1996-97 FA Cup'], ['[TABLECONTEXT]', 'TIE_NO', '1'], ['1', 'AWAY_TEAM', 'Nottingham Forest'], ['1', 'SCORE', '1-0'], ['1', 'HOME_TEAM', 'Chesterfield']]<n><n>### Response:<n>		Finally, I would like to talk about the sentence you are about to write using triplets. First, 'TABLECONTEXT' with the sentence structure you have provided. Here, I will use 'table' which is the common term used to refer to a place and this comes from the nested clause you have included in your list of candidates, which can refer to multiple entities such as the subject. The pattern you include within this clause fits both a time travel story and the biblical story of the Flood. This sub-clause leaves open a multitude of possibilities so be creative with the design. Items in the clause can represent all the factual details Mike mentioned and can also refer to the names or words of specific people. For example 'Tiddler', 'DOLBY' could refer to someone who owns a tiddler printing business (like Tigger from the cartoon, Tonto from the show Cheers and the needless rotation played by the tiddler in this story), or the name of a famous composer. Other objects that could be used in this sentence to represent the eternal life of each triplet are the postal code in the type of triplet that you want to use and lots of seeds that Bill produced as he was a toddler growing up in the 1940s in Iowa

We also suggest candidates for future work, such as exploring failure modes and finding directions for future work.

DNA vaccines are currently used in veterinary medicine, but have not achieved widespread acceptance for use in humans due to their low immunogenicity in early clinical studies. However, recent clinical data have re-established the value of DNA vaccines, particularly in priming high-level antigenspecific antibody responses. Several approaches have been investigated for improving DNA vaccine efficacy, including advancements in DNA vaccine vector design, the inclusion of genetically engineered cytokine adjuvants, and novel non-mechanical delivery methods. These strategies have shown promise, resulting in augmented adaptive immune responses in not only mice, but also in large animal models. Here, we review advancements in each of these areas that show promise for increasing the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines.<n><n>### Response:<n>		DNA vaccines are currently used in clinical medicine, but have not yet achieved widespread acceptance.

Use all of the information provided.<n><n>### Input:<n>name[xname], recommend[yes], cuisine[New American], decor[bad], location[Manhattan], price[cheap], service[bad]<n><n>### Response:<n>		There is a new American restaurant in Manhattan called, appropriately, Ol' Lemon. The restaurant offers a New American menu with an emphasis on American cooking, which includes spicy chicken wings, lobster bisque, and a variety of other dishes. I've been to the restaurant several times and like its decor, including paintings of local landmarks, art of painting  delicacies. The menu includes both a standard Broadway menu as well as smaller variants for people of various income levels. The restaurant is open from 11 am-8 pm daily. The decor is cozy and the ambiance is cheerful. The food is excellent, though I don't think it would hold a large crowd. The menu is $25 for mid-day meals, $30 for night out, and most of the restaurants seems to serve a fairly low-alcoholic cocktail which helps mitigate the taste. There are frequent closed social events and happy hour specials throughout the day.

Here is a list of those levels:<n><n>Level 1 : Columns<n>Level 2 : Beam<n>Level 3 : Slabs<n>Level 4 : Table<n>If we consider that each level has dimensions, we can simplify to a 2-level maximum of overlap length for a column and 4-level minimum of overlap length for a beam and slab.<n><n>To start with, consider two geometry examples with an arbitrary sized platform. If we want our abstract platform to have a width of 100 pixels and height of 10 pixels, we can assign a collision height of 10 pixels to the beam and the horizontal dimensions of 100 pixels and the vertical dimensions of 10 pixels. Similarly if we want our platform to have a width and height of 500 pixels, we can assign collision heights of 500 pixels to the beam and 0 pixels to the slab. Applying this approach to the 2x dimensions reduces the overlap length to a minimum of 0.64 pixels, which reproduces the data best.<n><n>Now consider our platform with a length width of 1, and a length height of 200 pixels. Consider the collision statistics for those dimensions. The current collision height, which is 0.64 pixels

Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) develop during embryogenesis in a complex process that involves multiple anatomical sites. Once HSC precursors have been specified from mesoderm, they have to mature into functional HSCs and undergo self-renewing divisions to generate a pool of HSCs. During this process, developing HSCs migrate through various embryonic niches, which provide signals for their establishment and the conservation of their self-renewal ability. These processes have to be recapitulated to generate HSCs from embryonic stem cells. Elucidating the interactions between developing HSCs and their niches should facilitate the generation and expansion of HSCs in vitro to exploit their clinical potential.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The first steps in the production of a new tissue are to identify a target organism. HSCs grow from a placental environment. You want to communicate your theory to recruit the first cells infertile from the uterus of a "strate site" and develop the HSC precursors.  These are the mammalian HSCs, which are in turn derived from rat testicular tissue. Once successfully identified, you want to recruit "stem cells." Dictionary definitions of "stem" as a complex collection of organelles inside and outside a cell refers to the differentiation of B cells and thereby contractilization of each of those cells through a potential fusion of its nuclei into a young adult. Among "stem cells," HSCs are the ones which up until now have been relegated as unproductive. And there is no clear use for HT cells, since they are not dividing or regulating any tissue (the progeny is post hoc in another sense). However, especially in the case of ED cells, they can through foraged by leukocytes. Growth of these cells confronts structural cells, and they induce a process in dendritic cells that triggers differentiation-related events. Either way, known as endoderm hypoplasia, marks a transition point at which we

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.<n><n>### Input:<n>Abstract: Labrador keratopathy (LK) is an acquired corneal degeneration thought to be caused by chronic exposure to solar irradiation. Reports so far suggest that it is a progressive or at least a stationary condition. There are no detailed reports on recommended therapy. A prospective clinical study was conducted to show regression of LK following extracapsular cataract extraction. Seventeen black patients (26 eyes) with LK and mature cataracts underwent extracapsular cataract extraction. The severity of the LK was recorded photographically pre- and postoperatively. The follow-up ranged from 6 to fifteen months. Twenty-four eyes (92%) showed regression of the LK. The reduction in exposure to ultraviolet light as a result of aphakic photophobia could be one of the factors which have led to the regression of the LK.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The study was conducted to show some degree of retraction of LK following surgical extracapsular catcall.
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.<n><n>### Input:<n>Abstract: A prospective clinical trial was conducted to estimate the rise in serum glucose level after an intravenous bolus of 50 ml of 50% dextrose solution (D-50) in the emergency department setting. Fifty one subjects with altered levels of consciousness were studied. Of these, 23 patients were known diabetics, and 28 were not diabetic. The change in glucose level for the total study group ranged from a low of 37 mg/dl to a high of 370 mg/dl, with a mean of 166 +/- 77 mg/dl. The mean for the diabetic and non-diabetic groups were 177 +/- 80 mg/dl and 154 +/- 75 mg/dl. These results suggest that serum glucose levels cannot be quantitatively predicted after a single intravenous bolus of D-50.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The medical literature clearly shows that changes in glucose levels can be observed following several hours of IV fluid boluses of glucose. Daily injections of 50% glucose may cause a significant decrease in overall glucose level, but the mechanism behind this is still unclear. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of a low dose of dexamethasone (50 mg/m²) in the treatment of patients with altered glucose levels. While observational studies suggest that significant improvements in glucose level are noted, no data show that this treatment modality presents any statistically significant improvement in the overall quality of life. Another reason why very low cost IV glucose administration is unclear.

The hit on the employee is severe and violates their employee handbook which says that "harassing or abusing (retaliation) is not allowed." Target has a zero tolerance policy on harassment and these screenshots show there were multiple employee accounts created to target and make fun of employees in the company. Target did not try to stop this employee from creating accounts and mocked him with slang that went viral.<n><n>Based on the screenshot, the employee responsible was none other than Ralph Lauren. She's selling and when she saw the bad deed happen, hired an attorney to defend herself and complained to management.

Blood samples were obtained before, and at 2 and 5 min after the administration of the neuromuscular blocker. The twitch response to 0.15 Hz was also evaluated. None of the 10 patients receiving vecuronium had a significant increase in plasma histamine concentration. In two of the 10 children receiving atracurium, the plasma histamine concentration increased markedly, but without any apparent clinical manifestations. Recovery of neuromuscular function (to 95% twitch height) after vecuronium 0.12 mg kg-1 was faster than after atracurium 0.6 mg kg-1 (P less than 0.02).<n><n>### Response:<n>		Given an abstract, generate the heading of this paper such that conveies the key focus of the article.<n><n>Vecuronium-0.12 mg kg- 1 halothane was administered to anaesthetized children to assess if such pharmacology could reverse the histamine-releasing potential of equivalent bolus dosing of atracurium.

The fascinating site, which has been described as "the worlds first permanent human settlement", is under construction and has been earmarked as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2020.

Nuclear arms provided the United States with the ability to deter in multiple ways, according to the “Persian Gulf experience” episodes of regional tensions and the strategic dynamics of the time, among other factors. Significant nuclear weapons would mitigate the effect that nuclear aggression could have on region. These strategies included deterring Russia from pursuing its ambitions and deterring other countries from considering behavior that was not in their national security interest.

These cases are unusual in that renal metastases are usually silent lesions discovered at autopsy. Review of the autopsy data from this hospital identified renal metastases in 19% of patients who died from carcinoma of the lung. This incidence parallels that of other series. A solid renal lesion which is identified in a patient with a history of pulmonary carcinoma should raise the suspicion of renal metastases, especially if computed tomography of the mass demonstrates relative homogeneity and minimal enhancement. More frequent use of the abdominal CT scan in staging patients with lung cancer will render metastatic carcinoma from lung to kidney a more frequent ante mortem diagnosis.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Clinic Cases of Severe Androgen Insufficiency<n>A.

Under 100 words is a good title length.<n><n>### Input:<n>Despite intensive ongoing research, key aspects of the spatial-temporal evolution of the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in Great Britain (GB) remain unexplained. Here we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models. We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected. We estimate how transmission parameters varied through time, highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species. Predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of GB are presented for the fitted models.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The scientific community continues to investigate the source of the 2001 FMD epidemic....... The factors that explain the geographic spread of this disease are still largely unknown. To date, there are a number of estimates, which range from 3-8 key parameters that contributed to the epidemic.

He had many distortions regarding Church teaching, Jansenism and Jewry which presented as rational belief where there was none. People often denounced him as a heretic. But his own biography and his teachings clearly provide solid rationale to hold the position his reputation. <n><n>Furthermore, some think that politically incorrect answers or brand statements inevitably gets in the way of people's tempers and can be seen as brainwashing.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

In chapter 13 of the book Paul tells us that his own son Jesus was sent to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ that could save those who believed in other gods.  And in Acts, he talks about how his own son Colossians brought Jesus to Jerusalem, and then writes home to tell his father, the Apostle James, who had been sent at the time to hear Paul's message.  James was also a member of the Roman church to which Paul belonged (called the Alexandrian church) in the 1st century. Through James and Paul's correspondence during the last months of his earthly ministry, and the subsequent encouragement of the Apostle James radicals to become part of the Christian church again, betray the assumption of all men that they were chosen by God and could speak for god. James tells Colossians that they could not gain any knowledge of god through hearing God's word alone.

This observation does not invalidate the concept of functional groupings within these anterior horn cell pools. In studies of the same segment in cords obtained at autopsy from patients with motor neuron disease, zones of focal loss of motor neurons were identified, without consistent severity or distribution at different sectional levels. These findings imply varying resistance to the disease in different pools of motor neurons.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In a three-dimensional study on the distribution of anterior horn cell regions in the C8 segment we have identified lateral and medial zones of regional motor neuron groupings. We have not been able to correctly distinguish between these groups. This observation has implications for labelling of motor neuron functional groups in future studies.

As the main contenders for the presidency, the two had to battle head-to-head from a range of primary and caucus candidates. In the end, we saw those two progressives elect together as a unit throughout the primary and caucus process. Watching from afar, I wondered if the two were destined to form a bloc and choose a distinctly more pro-European (diversity, anti-big business) candidate over their equally divisive and often upstart ex-leader. Looking more closely, it's fairly obvious from Lech's campaign rhetoric that he adshered to an anti-globalist agenda, the kind of thinking that fueled the far right for decades.  <n>But if you look at all the statecraft and procedural details that made up your polling place count, I saw none of that at the ballot box.

This dynamic structure physically connects neighboring epithelial cells, couples intercellular adhesive contacts to the cytoskeleton, and helps define each cell's apical-basal axis. Together these activities coordinate the form, polarity, and function of all cells in an epithelium. Several molecules regulate AJ formation and integrity, including Rho family GTPases and Par polarity proteins. However, only recently, with the development of live-cell imaging, has the extent to which E-cadherin is actively turned over at junctions begun to be appreciated. This turnover contributes to junction formation and to the maintenance of epithelial integrity during tissue homeostasis and remodeling.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The epithelial adherin-catenin complex binds primarily to cytoskeletal molecules and regulatory and signaling molecules and undergoes dynamic trafficking to form mature junction (AJ)

The twin peaks of spring and autumn produce many memorable seasons for Chinese families. Spring attracts regattaers to their seaside villas and summer weddings, and autumn brings thick fog and gloomy weather that poke fun at the consumption of old clothes and donuts.Due to its emphasis on fresh, local ingredients, the restaurant in question, Odersky Garden Restaurant, takes inspiration from the traditional Chinese seafood. Among the menu items, the iconic fried pork buns and crispy pineapple assets are tempered with more regional dishes.The tranquil garden setting makes dining and drinking spiritual experiences, imbuing the optimistic atmosphere with limitless possibilities.

Mapping such syntactic variants into semantic concepts that can be understood by robots is challenging due to the high flexibility of natural language expressions. To tackle this problem, we collect robotic commands for navigation and manipulation tasks using crowdsourcing. We further define a robot language and use a generative machine translation model to translate robotic commands from natural language to robot language. The main purpose of this paper is to simulate the interaction process between human and robots using crowdsourcing platforms, and investigate the possibility of translating natural language to robot language with paraphrases.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In this text, the robot navigation commands are "zoom", "downhill", and "east".<n>My friend Mike, your esteemed friend from Dilbert, designed "Zoom".

At each timestep, zoneout stochastically forces some hidden units to maintain their previous values. Like dropout, zoneout uses random noise to train a pseudo-ensemble, improving generalization.

We perform an empirical investigation of various RNN regularizers, and find encouraging results: zoneout gives significant performance improvements across tasks, yielding state-ofthe-art results in character-level language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset and competitive results on word-level Penn Treebank and permuted sequential MNIST classification tasks.<n><n>### Response:<n>		zoneout (black box) is a novel approach for regularizing RNN model outputs, <n>potentially increasing performance.<n>The deployment of zoneout serves as a powerful tool for identifying and solving problems in the deep learning world.<n>Guido van Rossum and Homer Gonzalez Merino

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Neural machine translation has shown very promising results lately. Most NMT models follow the encoder-decoder framework. To make encoder-decoder models more flexible, attention mechanism was introduced to machine translation and also other tasks like speech recognition and image captioning. We observe that the quality of translation by attention-based encoder-decoder can be significantly damaged when the alignment is incorrect. We attribute these problems to the lack of distortion and fertility models. Aiming to resolve these problems, we propose new variations of attention-based encoderdecoder and compare them with other models on machine translation. Our proposed method achieved an improvement of 2 BLEU points over the original attentionbased encoder-decoder.<n><n>### Response:<n>		While the original attention-based encoder and encoder-decoder were designed to improve the translation of text, our proposed system is capable of performing even better.  According to our theory, the alignment of the translation information is more accurate when the alignment is reversed. To put it simply, our proposed encoding system is more accurate and can even outperform the original one.  Therefore, we propose to replace the bursting noise model with a more accurate and portable model to achieve the best result we could for the text to American readers.

The general form of a Gauchais reaction is represented by the Greek letter "rathein", which corresponds to the letter r, the angle in the circle. Occasionally eau-chais is used in place of the letter "rathein" to denote an enigmatic quantity which is never fully explained.<n><n>The phenomenon is referred to as the "rathein gas", and it is believed that whenever a Conic section is completed below the zero-point limit of a Conic section of a circle the Gas predominates. To explain it let R denote the pull of Conic section 20 on the length of the sides constituting the segment, and H denote H², thereby representing the velocity of the gas. The idea that we can recall past cases is further interpreted by stating that in these cases cases the forces exerted by both sides were the force of conservation of constant area, i.e. of square law, and that the symmetry and order of nature of the calculation forces resulted in the result being symmetric.

The years went by and i kept forgetting it happened. I kept reading posts about how investors love or hate bitcoin. But i could not find the proof as to why i couldn't get no satisfaction. So i started a thread at bts thread to search for any hints and i was able to accomplish that. Btw, don't you hope my answers are mistaken, because it hurts me if you buy bts and immediately say this is stupid or very high risk, i will NEVER buy from you again because you are shady. I promise- i will be more patient. It was an uphill battle.

A proper question is the correct form of the question without any disfluency.<n><n>### Input:<n>How is it or rather what is it estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by?<n><n>### Response:<n>		That is estimated that roughly half of all variance in homicide rates can be attributed to potential confounders, such as family background, ethnicity, and cognitive ability.<n><n>The individual factors that influence the observed homicide rates vary dramatically across time, habitats, and educational systems.<n>One can try to account for this variation by, for example, applying theories developed in the first half century of criminology that emphasized multiple sources of "variation" in homicide rates including confounding by crime rates, housing availability, and the incidence of homicide during incarceration, among others. However, this approach would require rewriting the analysis of all individual factors, attribute these to a particular background and then apply this mechanism to a larger sample.<n><n>The benefit of empirically unraveling the Mendelian mechanism requires empirical knowledge about homicide rates. The debate on the mechanisms of variation in homicide has generated more than one volume on this topic -- most recently Peter L. Spence's Evolutionary Models and Homicide and the Mendelian Factor.

Stalin's obsession with the accumulation of surplus created a cycle that brought ever decreasing returns on capital.  Even if one assumes economic growth, over the great period of socialist expansion there were never corresponding periods when the capitalists' yields were above 10%, with their excess capital spent  pursued at full take-profit.  From 1900 to present, during 9/11, one can see how walking through this period helped Corbyn, whose Labour government chose not to enforce any new rule to combat this trend.

Sitting in the sun makes no sense because the lungs are sealed shut. Outside is cold. Day in, day out, the process of breathing makes no sense upon waking up. I sat thinking about Newton's First law of motion realizing that all explanation and thought can have an equivalent in language. You cannot speak the words of a dictionary to understand the First Law of motions if you don't take steps to physically grasp it. Someone walks into a room with a blank piece of paper and says to the person sitting in the chair,  " this was written down in a book." The person looks up at the blank piece of paper, ponders for a moment, then continues, " some time ago this happened to me". The person argues that, if the First law is not translated by physical motion, then it cannot be applied to language because it is a timeless law, the laws of physics, yet no one can say that it cannot apply to social life or events. Hence, I decided to reverse the Rotational Equations as written down by me into their literal translation by taking steps backward. First I broke Newton's Second Law yet again over and over again. Fourth, I continued to

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Recently deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to learn speaker features. However, the quality of the learned features is not sufficiently good, so a complex back-end model, either neural or probabilistic, has to be used to address the residual uncertainty when applied to speaker verification, just as with raw features. This paper presents a convolutional timedelay deep neural network structure (CT-DNN) for speaker feature learning. Our experimental results on the Fisher database demonstrated that this CT-DNN can produce highquality speaker features: even with a single feature (0.3 seconds including the context), the EER can be as low as 7.68%. This effectively confirmed that the speaker trait is largely a deterministic short-time property rather than a long-time distributional pattern, and therefore can be extracted from just dozens of frames.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Recently deep neural network (DNNs) has been used to learn speaker traits.

While MF based models have been extensively exploited in the graph modeling and link prediction literature, the AE family has not gained much attention. In this paper we investigate both MF and AE’s application to the link prediction problem in sparse graphs. We show the connection between AE and MF from the perspective of multiview learning, and further propose MF+AE: a model training MF and AE jointly with shared parameters. We apply dropout to training both the MF and AE parts, and show that it can significantly prevent overfitting by acting as an adaptive regularization. We conduct experiments on six real world sparse graph datasets, and show that MF+AE consistently outperforms the competing methods, especially on datasets that demonstrate strong non-cohesive structures.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Link Prediction Problem with Sparse Rats

However, for more realistic and more complex models than those assuming homogeneous mixing in the population, other threshold quantities can be defined that are sometimes more useful and easily derived in terms of model parameters. In this paper, we present a model for the spread of a permanently immunizing infection in a population socially structured into households and workplaces/schools, and we propose and discuss a new household-to-household reproduction number R H for it. We show how R H overcomes some of the limitations of a previously proposed threshold parameter, and we highlight its relationship with the effort required to control an epidemic when interventions are targeted at randomly selected households.<n><n>### Response:<n>		R 0 is the most important concept in infectious disease epidemiology. It can be modeled as a process with several steps: 1. Determine the threshold quantity (eg. 100 words) to describe some statistical phenomenon for the distribution of infectious diseases. 2. Model the distribution of the annual infectious disease burden over time. 3. Determine the size of the uniform and ordered sample and assume that needles are randomly distributed in order to estimate the probability of sharing. 4. Estimate the power of community-level control without relying on random contaminators.

Eisenhower Professional Development Program) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish a new part D (State Incentives for Teacher Testing and Merit Pay). <n>Directs the Secretary of Education to make an award to each State that:  (1) administers a test to each elementary school and secondary school teacher in the State, with respect to the subjects taught by the teacher, every three to five years; and (2) has an elementary school and secondary school teacher compensation system based on merit. <n>Allows States to use Federal education funds for teacher testing and merit pay programs.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Title II (Dwight Eisenhower Professional Development Program) was reauthorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education act of 1965. The intent was to establish incentives for teacher preparation via test results and merit payments. Seventeen States administer teacher preparation tests at both public and private schools and a majority of these tests result in tested positive test scores. In 1998, the US Congress passed the bipartisan Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Act, which made teacher preparation testing and merit payments a federal responsibility. The result of this bill is the Improvement School Climate and Accountability Act, which gives States a variety of incentives for teachers to test in high performing schools to test for the teacher certification test, Placement Test, or the Common Core Curriculum Verifier.
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task you're given a question and you have to paraphrase the question to create the output question while retaining the meaning of the original question.<n><n>### Input:<n>What facts about the United States do foreigners not believe until they come to America?<n><n>### Response:<n>		First, Americans are law-abiding and generally consider themselves as free people. Second, in fact, the Founding Fathers established a system and legal framework for the right of all Americans to bear arms in defense of their country. The Writ of Habeas Corpus, an edict of habeas corpus issued by the US government, limited individuals' ability to bear arms, as well as prohibited the carrying of arms inside the US itself. This constitutional provision is enshrined in the Second Amendment, issued by the Founding Fathers, adding federal sovereignty into the US constitution. Third, under the US constitution, any person, not a US state or its agencies or instrumentalities, may petition the US supreme court for an "enrichment of religion" exemption on the basis of article five of the US constitution. This exemption protects religious institutions from the imposition of Jim Crow laws, and is referred to as the First Amendment. Finally, contrary to popular belief, Americans have long treasured their independence and are thankful for institutionalized slavery in the US Constitution and after the abolition of slavery it re-established slavery through the enactment of the Jim Crow Act which prohibited how blacks could be executed.

The factors that determine the stimulatory potency of a pMHC molecule remain unclear. We describe results showing that a peptide exhibiting many hallmarks of a weak agonist stimulates T cells to proliferate more than the wild-type agonist ligand. An in silico approach suggested that the inability to form the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) could underlie the increased proliferation. This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed that enhancing cSMAC formation reduced stimulatory capacity of the weak peptide. Our studies highlight the fact that a complex interplay of factors determines the quality of a T cell antigen.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Article title: T cell activation is predicated upon the interaction between the T cells receptor and peptide-Major histocompatibility (Pepse) ligands.

Historically, people have always been attracted to the opposite sex. As a result, there's little or no discrimination against people who are attracted to the opposite sex, including in marriages. <n><n>In contrast, people who are divorced and have children often exhibit behavior and choices that are both immoral, such as gambling, drug abuse, adultery, and car theft. This behavior is not excused by the law, as adultery is defined as a transgression, and indeed, when it's committed by a spouse it's considered a homicide. Wives share equally in the pain and trouble involved in raising children; according to anti-family activists, coming out as gay lowers children’ racial IQ and makes their mothers reflect on their sacrifice and compare them to the antebellum South. Children grow up imperfect, arc missing limbs, engage in behaviors and desires that are totally outside of their biological environment, and suffer security failures that would shock adult humans. Another example of immoral behavior, which is not judged by law, is child sexual abuse, which wipes out healthy limb muscles, causes permanent damage, and damages the physical and mental health of the child.

We compiled several relevant and appropriate requirement quality attributes and sentence rules from previous literatures and adopt it to come out with a set of ambiguity attributes that most suit Malay words. The extracted Malay ambiguous words (potential) are then being mapped onto the constructed ambiguity attributes to confirm their vagueness. The list is then verified by Malay linguist experts. This paper aims to identify a list of potential ambiguous words in Malay as an attempt to assist writers to avoid using the vague words while documenting Malay Requirement Specification as well as to any other related Malay documentation. The result of this study is a list of 120 potential ambiguous Malay words that could act as guidelines in writing Malay sentences.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Malay Words: <n>Requirement Specification

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Despite the successes in capturing continuous distributions, the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discrete settings, like natural language tasks, is rather restricted. The fundamental reason is the difficulty of backpropagation through discrete random variables combined with the inherent instability of the GAN training objective. To address these problems, we propose Maximum-Likelihood Augmented Discrete Generative Adversarial Networks. Instead of directly optimizing the GAN objective, we derive a novel and low-variance objective using the discriminator’s output that follows corresponds to the log-likelihood. Compared with the original, the new objective is proved to be consistent in theory and beneficial in practice. The experimental results on various discrete datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In this task you are presented with a paragraph with text such as "Thomas first extracted data on the probability distribution function, originally known as Neyman-Sundblad. Invented the dating algorithm Marcé Neyman-Sundbladsurvault in 1934 after noticing a trend in Neyman's distribution function used in a wine test, which caused his company to buy the rights to the formula. Thirteen years later, he patented his solution in 1944, hoping it would revolutionize dating methods. The Law firm Neyman & Sundblad rose to supreme prominence in the industry, and Neyman-Sundblados became industry staples. Despite a series of misguided attempts to market Neyman-Sundblades, profits soared in the markets, and global giants such as Ernst and Young followed suit. The childhood leukemia Neyman faced in 1944 convinced him to return to his trucking career. Neil Gammell, Neyman’s son, organized the first public Pepsi commercial, in 1957. The company included Neyman in the executive cadet program and the Bauhaus movement exploded across the industry, in particular the United States and Maharashtra, the largest state in India."

Is it because the Bollywood audience are so fond of sex? Are they always horny?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Yes, this is due to the rampant proliferation of Internet and social media. Baby boomers are the generation who consume movies and music on a regular basis. As they grew up, they started having multiple choices to watch movies and started consuming more music, all the while they were still brand-new to film-making. This generation is constitutionally inclined towards having a high number of sex scenes therefore causing them to crave it. A recent study seems to support this hypothesis and shows that the number of sex scenes in an artist's movies rise up to a semi-social norm with the MBTL survey sampling period reaching its peak from 2004-2007. Moreover, the popularity of such behavioret amongst female moviegoers is also on the rise. <n><n>According to some, as times get more affordable and there is a need for tasteful sex scenes, this generation likes to watch the all-encompassing variety of films as their choices.<n><n>As a picky eater and asexual, searching for the perfect sexual act will appeal to me, seeing as I was once a child, young lady in need of companionship.

Unions can be seen as organizations and governments because of their focus on bringing about universal benefits for all members of society. Even if labor unions are purely benevolent and designed to solve social    problems, universal benefits are what make them   unique, unique notwithstanding individual individual labor struggles. <n>2. Furthermore, labor unions have an interest to restrict exploitation because as labor costs rise, so do the prices of goods and services. Productivity is curtailed because those benefits cannot continually be met by labor, but unions typically enforce product price controls.<n>3. Thus, disobedience is not only possible, but also desirable. <n>This proposal bears striking similarities to a reduced and transformed version of the atonement theme adopted by the biblical account of Jesus' crucifixion. <n>The idea of disobedience comes close to the idea of non-aggression because non-aggression means that someone has no moral obligation to continue performing an act which would cause harm or injury to them - hence the idea of divine retribution.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>State-space models are successfully used in many areas of science, engineering and economics to model time series and dynamical systems. We present a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning (i.e. state estimation and system identification) in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. We place a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, resulting in a flexible model able to capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efficient inference, we marginalize over the transition dynamics function and infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using specially tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution can be formulated analytically. Our approach preserves the full nonparametric expressivity of the model and can make use of sparse Gaussian processes to greatly reduce computational complexity.<n><n>### Response:<n>		State-space model can be used to generate headline for text.

When riders near by, it was Rodriguez who asked them to hold up their hands to prove that they were not holding his rebar. This simple gesture directed all the riders to accept their fate. Railway officials generally balked, considering the effectiveness of psychological deterrents, but they were satisfied with the results. In September 2006, Rodriquez was awarded a $1 billion contract by the Department of Transportation to develop and test a satellite antenna to deter railroad riders from manual labor, which he had hidden from sight five years earlier.

Previous research mainly focuses on producing a colored image to match the original one. However, since many colors share the same gray value, an input grayscale image could be diversely colored while maintaining its reality. In this paper, we design a novel solution for unsupervised diverse colorization. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative adversarial networks to model the distribution of real-world item colors, in which we develop a fully convolutional generator with multi-layer noise to enhance diversity, with multi-layer condition concatenation to maintain reality, and with stride 1 to keep spatial information. With such a novel network architecture, the model yields highly competitive performance on the open LSUN bedroom dataset. The Turing test of 80 humans further indicates our generated color schemes are highly convincible.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The subject of this text is colorization of grayscale (gray) images. The literature focuses on producing a colored color image to match the original image. However, since many grayscale images have different values, the accuracy of the generated image is affected by the availability or quality of the available colors. We develop a new network architecture to recover and preserve reality, using multi-layer noise and continuous noise convolutional generator. Our reduced training set with respect to the dependant dataset yields highly competitive performance.

However, designing studies around the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology POR criteria can be methodologically challenging, as the new definition includes various POR subpopulations with diverse baseline characteristics and unknown clinical prognosis. When designing RCTs, potential result bias may be introduced if women from each subpopulation are not evenly allocated between intervention groups. In the case of small or moderate-size RCTs, a single-sequence randomization method may not ensure balanced allocation between groups. Stratified randomization methods provide an alternative methodological approach. Depending on the chosen methodology, patient characteristics and outcomes within each intervention group may be better reported according to relevant subpopulations.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Article title should be under thirty words.

They've been out and about trying to win the votes of party members who will decide on the winner. With less than three weeks to go until the result, what's been happening over the past seven days of campaigning?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Jeremy Hunt is the leader of the Conservative Party as currently elected, Boris Johnson is the recent candidate for this position, as an Independent and as a result of a long-standing party control, they have neither a majority nor a mandate to form the next government and so must all but guarantee that the next government will be less than two years in power. Both candidates are disliked by most members of the mainstream Conservative Party and other prominent figures in the Party internally, including some of its most senior staff, including Sir John Chaperlain, the former head of the House of Commons and now Shadow Attorney General.<n><n>The situation has become so toxic that the public mood has changed since Boris Johnson first made his entry into the race - partly because people no longer perceive it as "the same old Theresa May drama" and partly because voters now view Jeremy Hunt as the clear front-runner, with the benefit of full control of the immigration system and policy levers,including nuclear weapons. An internal campaign indicates that above 15% of party members and candidates are now supporting Brexit and voting for Johnson. Not only are many more people looking to Boris Johnson to replace May, but many others are uniquely attracted by his pragmatic approach and proven competence in running a government that has been beset by great incompetence and

I spotted her on her girlfriend's tab and assumed she was anything but friend or lover.  Initially, I thought she looked like a meme, but I quickly made eye contact and tried again to explain the situation.  I thought maybe she thought I was nuts and needed mental health counseling.  As I explained the situation, she made a face and said "it's a dogey!".      A few minutes later, she apologized profusely, but wouldn't take a moment to get back to the restaurant.   Her description was fast-paced and prevalent, channeling memes, so it was hard for her to process what was being said.  From her perspective, this aggravated me, but she was quickly able to bounce back to the day's events and make jokes about my suffering.  The latter was more challenging because reactions on the internet vary widely.  Some people may interpret everything I said as meaning "we should go to some temple/church/gym/gym/church/the Internet tells you we must", and some may interpret my attempts at humor as rudeness or mean-spiritedness.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.<n><n>### Input:<n>Abstract: Five children, aged 6 to 16 years, were tested for unilateral discrimination and interhemispheric transfer of tactile information as well as tactuomotor learning at various intervals before and after therapeutic callosotomy. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children. Bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms. The most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways. The relatively greater deficits observed in the older children, on the other hand, suggest that sensorimotor functions come to depend more extensively on contralateral pathways as the corpus callosum reaches functional maturity.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Biology, Therapy, Learning

The direct effect on stimulated SA production of pre-incubating cells with prednisolone in vitro was also studied. Significant inhibition of monocyte SA output stimulated with IgG-treated zymosan (ITZ) and fluoride ion (F), but not serum-treated zymosan (STZ) was demonstrated following steroid therapy in RA. No inhibitory effect of prednisolone could be demonstrated in vitro, using ITZ, STZ and F as stimuli. Our data on blood monocyte yields, size and cytochemistry suggest that the in vivo effect is due to a shift in blood monocyte traffic.<n><n>### Response:<n>		RA patients treated with corticosteroids had significant decreases in their serum levels of phosphodiesterase-1,[24] which was associated with increases in plasma levels of IL-1B.[25] The mechanism underlying this reduction in serum levels of SOX1 could potentially involve a mechanism of reduced Rheumatoid Arthritis activity, which is now being studied in vivo using anti-RA antibodies.

I guess the saddest thing about me is that I think I found happiness and love for a truly unquenchable thirst that quickly turned to anger and fear. To this day, whenever I get close to an open window, I relive the experience. For nearly seven years I worked in a sales environment building and managing receivables. I once noticed that some of my coworkers had unusually thick chemistry. They each had their own unique chemistry, and as an experimenter and lover of chemistry, I saw this as none of my business. I was shocked. This bothered me. It turned me on, and I began to think about building a 'Teh Querest' chemistry during our assigned quiet time. I really should not have known they were loyal, and I should have just let them work alone, but I did not wish to deter them, and they strove to brighten our work by being brave and extrovert. I can vouch for that the diverse chemistry with which they worked shaped our careers. What amazed me even more, was how much I wanted to help them - desperately didn't want to stop them from improving in whatever capacity; I wanted them to raise their work capacity. God knows they've had nights where I

The model, parameterized by Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Processes, overcomes the limitations of previous generative models by allowing fast and accurate inference. We propose an efficient decoding algorithm based on particle filtering that can adapt the beam size to the uncertainty in the model while jointly predicting POS tags and parse trees. The UAS of the parser is on par with that of a greedy discriminative baseline. As a language model, it obtains better perplexity than a n-gram model by performing semi-supervised learning over a large unlabelled corpus. We show that the model is able to generate locally and syntactically coherent sentences, opening the door to further applications in language generation.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The European parliament has published a draft resolution on the transboundary pricing of medicines.

While finite-horizon DECPOMDPs have enjoyed significant success, progress remains slow for the infinite-horizon case mainly due to the inherent complexity of optimizing stochastic controllers representing agent policies. We present a promising new class of algorithms for the infinite-horizon case, which recasts the optimization problem as inference in a mixture of DBNs. An attractive feature of this approach is the straightforward adoption of existing inference techniques in DBNs for solving DEC-POMDPs and supporting richer representations such as factored or continuous states and actions. We also derive the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize the joint policy represented as DBNs. Experiments on benchmark domains show that EM compares favorably against the state-of-the-art solvers.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Theorem 0. Optimized policy as DBNs.

Since the start of the crisis with the West, Iran has shown its blind spots, brazenly disregarding any obligations under the historic deal with world powers. Tehran violates the embargo and continues to enrich uranium while developing ballistic missiles capable of reaching American allies like the Philippines or a US ally like Turkey. This new law does not make us cower in fear and allow Washington to remain blind and allow Iran to advance further towards acquiring nuclear weapons. The evil Radicals won't be deterred by this unjust regulation and we vow to continue to continue punishing the regime for their falls. This important step towards de-Baiting Iran is an essential part of ensuring our unwavering support for the new government and ensuring a sustainable Middle East that we can all join and work for.  We support efforts to protect the innocent majority, including the disabled, elderly and defenseless, and call upon the world to join us in ending this terrible regime.

The comparative location of the aberratic band, the most concentrated in the companion star to the star that is closest to the Sirius A, B cluster and G star cluster, also allows for its identification as a gas cloud associated with the Sirius B exoplanet system.

It does this in two ways: proxy servers and relays. These servers serve as a back door : they are routed through relays and are not monitored. When you use VPN, you connect to a server which is not monitored. So technically you can use a VPN to encrypt all traffic but you will still be able to see any traffic routed through the VPN servers. Have a look at the table :<n>VPN server :   proxy server <n>Relay server : relay server <n>Tor relays: anonymizer and relaysolidation <n>Tor Browser  VPN proxy: browser proxy

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>The current reference curves of stature and weight for the UK were first published in 1966 and have been used ever since despite increasing concern that they may not adequately describe the growth of present day British children. Using current data from seven sources new reference curves have been estimated from birth to 20 years for children in 1990. The great majority of the data are nationally representative. The analysis used Cole's LMS method and has produced efficient estimates of the conventional centiles and gives a good fit to the data. These curves differ from the currently used curves at key ages for both stature and weight. In view of the concerns expressed about the current curves and the differences between them and the new curves, it is proposed that the curves presented here should be adopted as the new UK reference curves.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Given the large number of data sources used for the analysis, it would be logical to develop a new UK reference curve. It is proposed that the new UK reference curves be based on the data from the age of 1 through the age of 20 years.

Most restaurants use a wine list, highlighting about 90 serious wine makers. The star rating is given "as a recommendation"; negative marks represent "no stars;" positive marks are "a lightning rod for wine-lover tributes to enjoy the restaurant first-hand." Restaurants must maintain a high standard of service, footprint footprint, sustainability, sustainability and preparedness, and continuously monitor and improve.

Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Activin/Nodal growth factors control a broad range of biological processes, including early cell fate decisions, organogenesis and adult tissue homeostasis. Here, we provide an overview of the mechanisms by which the Activin/Nodal signalling pathway governs stem cell function in these different stages of development. We describe recent findings that associate Activin/Nodal signalling to pathological conditions, focusing on cancer stem cells in tumorigenesis and its potential as a target for therapies. Moreover, we will discuss future directions and questions that currently remain unanswered on the role of Activin/Nodal signalling in stem cell self-renewal, differentiation and proliferation.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The Activin/Nodral signaling pathway regulates adult stem cell function, i.e. cell division and differentiation, as well as adult tissue homeostasis and adult tissue remodelling. Here we describe emerging evidence that Activin/Nodial signalling regulates stem cell function in some cancers as well as its potential as a potential treatment for some.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We develop a new model for Interactive Question Answering (IQA), using GatedRecurrent-Unit recurrent networks (GRUs) as encoders for statements and questions, and another GRU as a decoder for outputs. Distinct from previous work, our approach employs context-dependent word-level attention for more accurate statement representations and question-guided sentence-level attention for better context modeling. Employing these mechanisms, our model accurately understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a supplementary question for additional input. When available, user’s feedback is encoded and directly applied to update sentence-level attention to infer the answer. Extensive experiments on QA and IQA datasets demonstrate quantitatively the effectiveness of our model with significant improvement over conventional QA models.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In this task you are given a part to write a headline for. It should include titles under 15 words. You also need to generate from the prescriber feedback to update the sentence level by using information from the prescriber's responses.

The 50-year-old from Liverpool has set off from Goodison Park and will spend 11 days on the road. He is raising money for the Woodlands Hospice. Mr Cullen has already raised more than £30,000 for the charity after also swimming the English Channel. He said he hoped to raise up to £50,000 in total and would be walking more than 200 miles "as the crow flies". "I am crazy," he admitted. "I am going to be sleeping in hotels each night and carrying as little as possible". Everton will face either Manchester United or West Ham in the 23 April clash.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Welcome to the cupboard!  Michael Cullen, 25, an English football fan, turned 50 years old this year and spends 11 days each week fundraising for the Woodlands Hospity.  He is joined on the journey by colleague Tom Neil and Jeremy Gilmartin, and many friends and family. And while the journey would normally take eleven days, it would likely involve a longer journey than that.  He has also debuted in the Premier League in the north west for the first time, while also raising money for the charity on the way.  In actuality, Michael is walking 200 miles a day, raising money regardless of whether he is playing football or working in a mundane office job.<n><n>There, we go! To the cup board!  The primary goals and objectives of this scheme, which many of you have already established, are to raise sufficient funds to provide for a proper care home for McFadden's little one, and to encourage further donations from fans, friends, family and friends of Michael.

The city I had grown up in had many places I didn't know. But despite the constant stares and discussions of my father every day, I never once considered crying.  This habit grew on me, and now we spend many hours arguing and scheming when we could instead spend our time together.  I want to tell you that I love you, that I care about you, and that I owe you everything.

Unfortunately, researchers working in this paradigm have re­ stricted much of their attention to rather sim­ ple representations of belief states, namely logically closed sets of propositional sen­ tences. In our opinion, this has resulted in a too abstract categorisation of belief change operations: expansion, revision, or contrac­ tion. Occasionally, in the AGM paradigm, also probabilistic belief changes have been considered, and it is widely accepted that the probabilistic version of expansion is con­ ditioning. However, we argue that it may be more correct to view conditioning and expan­ sion as two essentially different kinds of belief change, and that what we call constraining is a better candidate for being considered prob­ abilistic expansion.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Re­volving belief

What is the difference between England, Britain and the UK?<n><n>### Response:<n>		The two basic interchangeable terms for England are “England and Wales” and “Britain”. The word “Britain” is a contraction used to distinguish it from England in the Constitution. <n><n>Britain considers itself to be independent and is the North East of England and Wales in the United Kingdom in perpetuity except for "for so far as is contiguous to and constituting part of Wales". <n><n>As such, the main difference between "England" and "Britain" is in the pronunciation of the word. Rather than a long hard "a" (often pronounced as 'a-yah'), the word is pronounced as "ee (a high pitched "l"). This pronunciation is common and widely spoken across the entire English-speaking world. It only became accented in England in the 15th century but over the centuries, the pronunciation has been gradually modified to the "e" sound more closely resembling the English "t." While the word was originally the diminutive form of "ancient Kent," by the 20th century sometimes called "County Kent," it was  finally confined to the "old Kent" with the creation of county Durham in 1957.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task you're given a question and you have to paraphrase the question to create the output question while retaining the meaning of the original question.<n><n>### Input:<n>Why is pewter so expensive, and how does its properties compare to those of gold?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Because of its aggressive expansion and high melting point, pewter shines brighter than its copper counterpart. (The copper alloy ingots are often called "pewter" because they contain copper alloy, which is how pewter works, rather than bronze which is its older metal designation.) Therefore, when reviewing pricing information, pewter manufacturers often target a customer by highlighting its rising cost.<n><n>For example, to measure the raw metal value of PEMDSA steel 57.9%, a set of pewter alloy rebar will be on average sold for $83.50, compared to $8.30 for copper; the raw material, rather than the alloy, determines the raw metal value. Quartz is commonly used in the pewter market because it can be sandblasted and chemically transformed, which elevates it to a very expensive alloy.<n><n>But quartz is not reflective, and it does not melt but remains brittle to nearly all impacts, blinding to direct contact with metals.<n><n>Even untreated copper flakes are formidable to pewter; heat can destroy such relatively easily as percussion in a plastics bag. When leveling commercial pewter workbenches, friction with foreign grades of steel causes many to break down immediately.<n><n>Unlike most

Standard label propagation fails to consider the properties of the label types and the interactions between them. Our proposed method, called EDGEEXPLAIN, explicitly models these, while still enabling scalable inference under a distributed message-passing architecture. On a billion-node subset of the Facebook social network, EDGEEXPLAIN significantly outperforms label propagation for several label types, with lifts of up to 120% for recall@1 and 60% for recall@3.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We tackle the<n>problem of inference<n>labels in a partially labeled graph

Twenty-five patients were anaesthetized with halothane at least 10 times in a year. No patient developed postoperative jaundice. Sixty-nine children were exposed to two halothane anaesthetics within 28 days on 149 occasions and serial estimations of serum liver enzyme concentrations were obtained. Minor increases in the concentrations of serum AST and ALT were recorded in 10.6% and 4.7% of patient entries, respectively. Postoperative GGT and SAP concentrations were increased in 2.7% of patient entries. Patients in whom enzyme values were increased before the first anaesthetic were no more likely than other subjects to develop further changes.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Subjects:<n>Children receiving 1362 halothane from 4 years in January 1981 to December 1984 were exposed to two anaesthetics, and subsequently had their liver enzyme concentrations increase. The increases in serum AST and ALT are significant and consistent with postoperative jaundice and impaired blood flow, and patients with elevated liver enzyme levels were at higher risk of complications.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task you're given a question and you have to paraphrase the question to create the output question while retaining the meaning of the original question.<n><n>### Input:<n>What would be the scenario of COE placement in Thapar University by 2020 considering the no. of students from CAG and CML too getting pushed in COE?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Based on the current number of students who will get pushed in COE, number of students who will drop out of the college and whom the college will need to take on extra COE courses such as BSW or CSCE that will be phased out in 2020, and as of the 2016-2020 reporting period, there are some 191 students within CAG and CML who will not be placed into either CAG or CML.  These students will then have to drop out of Thapar University.  This leaves 181 students from CAG and 181 students from CML with zero or one CAG or ML placements.  The combined total will be 510 students who will have to drop out by 2020 and this will be based on a Wall Street Journal article written on October 9th, 2020, where the impacted COE groups were revealed.  The article cited a U.S. Census data that shows that approximately 202,400 students moved to US from India between 2004 and 2020, a 9.36% increase from 1907.  This resultates that if Thai ranks were taking into consideration, the cut-off for COE placement for students from CAG and CM occurs at 81 and 81 respectively.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Academic researchers often need to face with a large collection of research papers in the literature. This problem may be even worse for postgraduate students who are new to a field and may not know where to start. To address this problem, we have developed an online catalog of research papers where the papers have been automatically categorized by a topic model. The catalog contains 7719 papers from the proceedings of two artificial intelligence conferences from 2000 to 2015. Rather than the commonly used Latent Dirichlet Allocation, we use a recently proposed method called hierarchical latent tree analysis for topic modeling. The resulting topic model contains a hierarchy of topics so that users can browse the topics from the top level to the bottom level. The topic model contains a manageable number of general topics at the top level and allows thousands of fine-grained topics at the bottom level. It also can detect topics that have emerged recently.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here is a list of the top seven headlines for the topics in which the research papers were presented: "AI: Summarizing the pre-MIT AI Revolution," "RIBAs reported paralysis due to drug resistance," "Computers create thousands of ways of taking human jobs," "Simpler drug-resistant medicine may not work as well as feared," "Assassin drug that blocks serotonergic system gives users less pain," "Researchers test wireless tear gas anticoagulant responses on rats," "Study points to autism-linked impairment of glial cells in development and inflammation," "Study: Autism-related brain alterations induce pain in mice and impair neurogenesis," "Food Frontiers: Broad University fighting foodism, wealth inequality," "Financial stress alters glial cells in mice," "Painkillers kill cognitive function in mice and treat chemically-induced depression," "New animal model enables better electrical brain stimulation"

We have assessed HPRT mutants in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with connective tissue diseases who have been treated for long periods with cytotoxic drugs. The results from patients treated with cyclophosphamide were abnormal suggesting the presence of drug-induced mutations. The results from patients treated with chlorambucil or azathioprine did not differ from controls--either these drugs have not induced mutations or, more likely, the technique is not sufficiently sensitive to detect them. These possibilities are discussed. Specific mutations induced by cytotoxic drugs in patients with connective tissue diseases have not been previously recorded.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Cells with mutations at the hypoxic-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferases (HPRT) drug-resistance locus may be detected by their resistance to toxic effects of thiiguanine.

The effect of taxes on social spending can be seen by considering the words, "investment," "investment," and "investment savings." All these words refer to money being put to use. Application of tax rates towards someone's social spending can affect a person's value of money. But what is the effect on someone’s value of their money? When the exchange price of newly issued dollar stock crosses a certain threshold, doing business in the United States, or purchasing a U.S. treasuries raises the price of the piece of U.S. paper money, which is their investment or savings. So what becomes of the old sentence if you replace it with the "It is the investment not the money" sentence? It is only the money instead of the old sentence.

The type II prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas adaptive immune system has been shown to facilitate RNA-guided site-specific DNA cleavage. We engineered two different type II CRISPR/Cas systems and demonstrate that Cas9 nucleases can be directed by short RNAs to induce precise cleavage at endogenous genomic loci in human and mouse cells. Cas9 can also be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with minimal mutagenic activity. Lastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided nuclease technology.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Abstract

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is used in virtually all state-of-the-art object detection pipelines. While essential object detection ingredients such as features, classifiers, and proposal methods have been extensively researched surprisingly little work has aimed to systematically address NMS. The de-facto standard for NMS is based on greedy clustering with a fixed distance threshold, which forces to trade-off recall versus precision. We propose a convnet designed to perform NMS of a given set of detections. We report experiments on a synthetic setup, and results on crowded pedestrian detection scenes. Our approach overcomes the intrinsic limitations of greedy NMS, obtaining better recall and precision.<n><n>### Response:<n>		A pedestrian detection scene would require an NMS that includes features, classifiers, proposal methods and recall.

That surely applies to any restaurant! Carolers, taking their chance after a long night at the pub, Gerry, the owner of the diner, and Mary, the creative secretary, were there to roll out the welcome mat. With tasty items such as burgers and juice boxes Carolers quickly became a popular eatery, and lunch was a success. After nearly 18 years at the top of the pecking order Luke, the great grandson of Dean, friend and co-owner, was given the reigns of the restaurant for 2014/2015. It was a breeding ground for quality, using ingredients thought of as traditional at home in the Farm, UK countryside. We dreamt of incorporating British ingredients, such as potatoes, Pasties and Capers, in everything we ate. Charlie, the creative chef, made kitchen equipment for the restaurant – Magnets, screens, bowls of sweet potato soup, fridges – all bought from the UK through working capital of Leith. The kitchen was run by great chef Brian Yule. We adored our servers Jackie, Jackie's amazing manager Barb, and Terry Gilbert, who, since Danny had transferred from a Michelin-starred chain, was the guide dog

For instance, these days, almost every south Asian country has an honour system that honors heroes or martyrs from different wars. It is not surprising that the happiness levels of South Asian citizens could be influenced by this system.<n>This system ultimately leads them to believe that their country or their people are great, worthy of admiration and devotion. This highly specific type of thinking and strong emotional association makes south Asian people try to convince people to take them seriously, and so they rely on the'placebo effect'. On the other hand, people from other countries may perceive South Asian sentiments in a different, negative perspective, regardless of how 'normal' South Asian society is.

This leads to the idea of'South Asian exceptionalism', which frequently leads to bad ideas

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>In the fashion industry, order scheduling focuses on the assignment of production orders to appropriate production lines. In reality, before a new order can be put into production, a series of activities known as pre-production events need to be completed. In addition, in real production process, owing to various uncertainties, the daily production quantity of each order is not always as expected. In this research, by considering the pre-production events and the uncertainties in the daily production quantity, robust order scheduling problems in the fashion industry are investigated with the aid of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) called nondominated sorting adaptive differential evolution (NSJADE). The experimental results illustrate that it is of paramount importance to consider pre-production events in order scheduling problems in the fashion industry. We also unveil that the existence of the uncertainties in the daily production quantity heavily affects the order scheduling.<n><n>### Response:<n>		During the research, it was shown that: “Pre-production events are fundamental to the fashion industry”

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.<n><n>### Input:<n>Abstract: The excretion of four inhibitors of urinary stone formation (zinc, magnesium, citrates and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) was studied in 20 normal controls and 40 recurrent calcium stone formers who were placed on a fixed diet restricted in calcium, oxalates and purines. We were unable to show any abnormality in the excretion of Zn, Mg or GAG. In 11 patients, a low level of urinary citrate was a significant feature that was associated in most cases with a urinary pH value above 6. Citrate concentration (per litre) and output (per 24 h) were found to be lower than in the controls in 19 and 33% respectively of the determinations. The overall ratio of average urinary citrate concentration in patients and controls was 0.56, a figure in agreement with previous data.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The excretion of four inhibitors (zinc, magnesium and citrates) was studied in 20 healthy controls and 40 recurrent calcium stones formers who were placed a fixed, restricted diet.
