DNA vaccines are currently used in veterinary medicine, but have not achieved widespread acceptance for use in humans due to their low immunogenicity in early clinical studies. However, recent clinical data have re-established the value of DNA vaccines, particularly in priming high-level antigenspecific antibody responses. Several approaches have been investigated for improving DNA vaccine efficacy, including advancements in DNA vaccine vector design, the inclusion of genetically engineered cytokine adjuvants, and novel non-mechanical delivery methods. These strategies have shown promise, resulting in augmented adaptive immune responses in not only mice, but also in large animal models. Here, we review advancements in each of these areas that show promise for increasing the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines.<n><n>### Response:<n>		DNA vaccines are currently used in Veterinary Medicine, but have not achieved wide acceptance for use in humans.

Here we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models. We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected. We estimate how transmission parameters varied through time, highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species. Predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of GB are presented for the fitted models.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Although intensive ongoing research, key features of the spatial-temetary evolution of the 2001 footand mouth disease (FMD), remain unexplained.

This observation does not invalidate the concept of functional groupings within these anterior horn cell pools. In studies of the same segment in cords obtained at autopsy from patients with motor neuron disease, zones of focal loss of motor neurons were identified, without consistent severity or distribution at different sectional levels. These findings imply varying resistance to the disease in different pools of motor neurons.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The C8 segment of the spinal cord is referred to as the dorsal horn, because this is the portion of the human spine that is involved in coordinating various functions in the human spinal cord.

Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>The epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin)-catenin complex binds to cytoskeletal components and regulatory and signaling molecules to form a mature adherens junction (AJ). This dynamic structure physically connects neighboring epithelial cells, couples intercellular adhesive contacts to the cytoskeleton, and helps define each cell's apical-basal axis. Together these activities coordinate the form, polarity, and function of all cells in an epithelium. Several molecules regulate AJ formation and integrity, including Rho family GTPases and Par polarity proteins. However, only recently, with the development of live-cell imaging, has the extent to which E-cadherin is actively turned over at junctions begun to be appreciated. This turnover contributes to junction formation and to the maintenance of epithelial integrity during tissue homeostasis and remodeling.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The article is to generate title for the article.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Neural machine translation has shown very promising results lately. Most NMT models follow the encoder-decoder framework. To make encoder-decoder models more flexible, attention mechanism was introduced to machine translation and also other tasks like speech recognition and image captioning. We observe that the quality of translation by attention-based encoder-decoder can be significantly damaged when the alignment is incorrect. We attribute these problems to the lack of distortion and fertility models. Aiming to resolve these problems, we propose new variations of attention-based encoderdecoder and compare them with other models on machine translation. Our proposed method achieved an improvement of 2 BLEU points over the original attentionbased encoder-decoder.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The proposed method to improve the accuracy of translation by attention-free encoder-decoder is based on the idea of attention-based decoder-decoder.

More specifically, we propose a skip-thought neighbor model to consider the adjacent sentences as a neighborhood. We train our skip-thought neighbor model on a large corpus with continuous sentences, and then evaluate the trained model on 7 tasks, which include semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, and classification benchmarks. Both quantitative comparison and qualitative investigation are conducted. We empirically show that, our skip-thought neighbor model performs as well as the skip-thought model on evaluation tasks. In addition, we found that, incorporating an autoencoder path in our model didn’t aid our model to perform better, while it hurts the performance of the skip-thought model.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The skip-thought model proposed in this text is a neighborhood information model.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Recently deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to learn speaker features. However, the quality of the learned features is not sufficiently good, so a complex back-end model, either neural or probabilistic, has to be used to address the residual uncertainty when applied to speaker verification, just as with raw features. This paper presents a convolutional timedelay deep neural network structure (CT-DNN) for speaker feature learning. Our experimental results on the Fisher database demonstrated that this CT-DNN can produce highquality speaker features: even with a single feature (0.3 seconds including the context), the EER can be as low as 7.68%. This effectively confirmed that the speaker trait is largely a deterministic short-time property rather than a long-time distributional pattern, and therefore can be extracted from just dozens of frames.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The Journalist

While MF based models have been extensively exploited in the graph modeling and link prediction literature, the AE family has not gained much attention. In this paper we investigate both MF and AE’s application to the link prediction problem in sparse graphs. We show the connection between AE and MF from the perspective of multiview learning, and further propose MF+AE: a model training MF and AE jointly with shared parameters. We apply dropout to training both the MF and AE parts, and show that it can significantly prevent overfitting by acting as an adaptive regularization. We conduct experiments on six real world sparse graph datasets, and show that MF+AE consistently outperforms the competing methods, especially on datasets that demonstrate strong non-cohesive structures.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The proposed model for sparse graphs is called "MF."  It uses a "matrix factorization" (MF) and an "Autoencoder" (AE) model, both of which have been extensively exploited in graph modeling and link prediction.  We show that both models can significantly prevent overfitting when used together, and that shared parameters can significantly influence the choice of which model to use.

However, for more realistic and more complex models than those assuming homogeneous mixing in the population, other threshold quantities can be defined that are sometimes more useful and easily derived in terms of model parameters. In this paper, we present a model for the spread of a permanently immunizing infection in a population socially structured into households and workplaces/schools, and we propose and discuss a new household-to-household reproduction number R H for it. We show how R H overcomes some of the limitations of a previously proposed threshold parameter, and we highlight its relationship with the effort required to control an epidemic when interventions are targeted at randomly selected households.<n><n>### Response:<n>		There is no generic definition of what a suitable title for this research paper would be.

In future what things should they keep in mind so that they don't make the same mistake again?<n><n>### Response:<n>		The NDA- led government in Bihar had a poor track record in getting things done in the state. The last assembly election, held in April 2015, was marred by violence and intimidation instigated by the Congress and the Hindu Rashtra Sangh (HRS). The NDA- led government initially used a slogan of "We are the people" which was not well received by the voters. It also did not take into consideration the religious beliefs of the people in the state. A lot of people were left feeling deprived and were not able to participate in the election. <n><n>It is imperative that the NDA- ledgovernment take into account the religious beliefs of the voters. If the government truly wants to ensure that the next election won't repeat itself, it should not make things worse by making things easier.

The factors that determine the stimulatory potency of a pMHC molecule remain unclear. We describe results showing that a peptide exhibiting many hallmarks of a weak agonist stimulates T cells to proliferate more than the wild-type agonist ligand. An in silico approach suggested that the inability to form the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) could underlie the increased proliferation. This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed that enhancing cSMAC formation reduced stimulatory capacity of the weak peptide. Our studies highlight the fact that a complex interplay of factors determines the quality of a T cell antigen.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The results of this task suggest that the stimulation capacity of a pMHC protein increases following stimulation by the weakly agonist ligand.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We describe here a methodology to identify a list of ambiguous Malay words that are commonly being used in Malay documentations such as Requirement Specification. We compiled several relevant and appropriate requirement quality attributes and sentence rules from previous literatures and adopt it to come out with a set of ambiguity attributes that most suit Malay words. The extracted Malay ambiguous words (potential) are then being mapped onto the constructed ambiguity attributes to confirm their vagueness. The list is then verified by Malay linguist experts. This paper aims to identify a list of potential ambiguous words in Malay as an attempt to assist writers to avoid using the vague words while documenting Malay Requirement Specification as well as to any other related Malay documentation. The result of this study is a list of 120 potential ambiguous Malay words that could act as guidelines in writing Malay sentences.<n><n>### Response:<n>		(1) “Malay Words” is a used word that has become common in Malay documents to describe things that are not Malay.<n>(2) “Optional Specification” is a Malay word that has become common among Malay documents to describe processes that do not fulfill some aspect of Malay identity, Belay customs, or cultural customs.<n>(3) “Possibilities” is a used in a verb to indicate that some aspect of the planned action might not involve based upon the person taking it upon themselves to act upon it. <n>(4) “Conversions” is the used word to indicate that the action is a judgement, incorporating all of the elements of the affirmative

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Despite the successes in capturing continuous distributions, the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discrete settings, like natural language tasks, is rather restricted. The fundamental reason is the difficulty of backpropagation through discrete random variables combined with the inherent instability of the GAN training objective. To address these problems, we propose Maximum-Likelihood Augmented Discrete Generative Adversarial Networks. Instead of directly optimizing the GAN objective, we derive a novel and low-variance objective using the discriminator’s output that follows corresponds to the log-likelihood. Compared with the original, the new objective is proved to be consistent in theory and beneficial in practice. The experimental results on various discrete datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Based on your task, I have generated the following headline for the article.

Is it because the Bollywood audience are so fond of sex? Are they always horny?<n><n>### Response:<n>		The reason that Bollywood movies contain too much sex scenes is that the Bollywood audience are, on average, much more attracted to the types of scenes that are depicted in Bollywood movies. The reason is that once the scenes are shot, they tend to be very explicit, with or without the typical act of showing affection between partners or sleeping with each other. In other words, the scenes tend to be more "sexy" than the typical R&B or E&B scene, and if Bollywood is indeed averse to "too much", it is because these types of scenes are not necessarily required in most movies.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task you're given a question and you have to paraphrase the question to create the output question while retaining the meaning of the original question.<n><n>### Input:<n>Why is circuit switching important?<n><n>### Response:<n>		The purpose of circuit switching is to provide a reliable and cheap way to implement a switching mechanism. In other words, it serves a dual function. On the one hand, it allows the switching element to be very inexpensive and available to a large number of potential devices. On the other hand, it also allows the switching mechanism to be very specific to the specific applications that require it. The specific switching mechanism is crucial to implement a properly functioning switching mechanism in a modern microprocessor or even a microcomputer specifically designed for use in those applications. The design constraints and the specific applications that need the switching mechanism often conflict in determining the best accessible switch that is appropriate for the particular task. Thus, in order to understand the specific switching mechanism needed to achieve a reliable and cheap switching mechanism, it is useful to first understand the specific types of circuits that need to be implemented and in what specific applications.

We present a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning (i.e. state estimation and system identification) in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. We place a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, resulting in a flexible model able to capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efficient inference, we marginalize over the transition dynamics function and infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using specially tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution can be formulated analytically. Our approach preserves the full nonparametric expressivity of the model and can make use of sparse Gaussian processes to greatly reduce computational complexity.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here is a sample from the smoothed state-space model:<n>### State-space models have successfully been used to predict the state-space model evolution in nonlinear non-dimensional state-space models. <n>Here is a sample of our Bayesian approach to inference:<n><n>Transform the model into a Naive Bayesian Estimate (NAD) model, with max and Min objective functions<n><n>The joint smoothing distribution may be computed directly from the discrete map<n><n>However, it must be used as an approximation to the real-world form, since the

The birth-weights of babies born to women with inflammatory bowel disease were marginally lower than those born to women in a control group matched for age and parity, but the difference was statistically significant only in women with Crohn's disease. In both disease groups there was a higher frequency of low haemoglobin levels in pregnancy than in the matched control groups. There were no statistically significant effects of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease on duration of pregnancy, mode of delivery or raised blood pressure and/or proteinuria. In the absence of a relapse, a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease should not influence obstetric management.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The research presented here suggests that although inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease) had a significant negative effect on pregnancy outcomes, it is unlikely to significantly impact childbirth outcomes.

A sham group acted as control. In comparison with the sham group, the specific activity of succinic dehydrogenase was slightly decreased and the activities of cytochromes b and c + c were decreased significantly 30 min after burning. All the results suggest a lack of increased metabolic activity during the early phase of burn injury.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Burning leads to increased respiratory control ratios of liver mitochondrialria in Sprague-Dawleys rats. The increase in respiratory control ratio is attributed to the decreased activity of cytochromes buccinct and c + c.

Previous research mainly focuses on producing a colored image to match the original one. However, since many colors share the same gray value, an input grayscale image could be diversely colored while maintaining its reality. In this paper, we design a novel solution for unsupervised diverse colorization. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative adversarial networks to model the distribution of real-world item colors, in which we develop a fully convolutional generator with multi-layer noise to enhance diversity, with multi-layer condition concatenation to maintain reality, and with stride 1 to keep spatial information. With such a novel network architecture, the model yields highly competitive performance on the open LSUN bedroom dataset. The Turing test of 80 humans further indicates our generated color schemes are highly convincible.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Under fifteen words

Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>The Bologna criteria for defining poor ovarian response (POR) during IVF provide a useful template for new research in this field of assisted conception. However, designing studies around the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology POR criteria can be methodologically challenging, as the new definition includes various POR subpopulations with diverse baseline characteristics and unknown clinical prognosis. When designing RCTs, potential result bias may be introduced if women from each subpopulation are not evenly allocated between intervention groups. In the case of small or moderate-size RCTs, a single-sequence randomization method may not ensure balanced allocation between groups. Stratified randomization methods provide an alternative methodological approach. Depending on the chosen methodology, patient characteristics and outcomes within each intervention group may be better reported according to relevant subpopulations.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Study recommendations for designing RCTs should incorporate (1) reporting characteristics of the participants and potential outcomes; (2) methods for randomization and stratification of participants; (3) allocation of patients according to their subpopulation; (4) summarization of the intervention and outcomes; and (5) suggestions for further research.

We develop a robustness metric derived from source-aware lower and upper bounds of model accuracy even when data source labels are not readily available. We clearly demonstrate that even on a well-explored dataset like MNIST, challenging training scenarios can be constructed under the proposed assessment framework for two separate yet equally important applications: i) more rigorous learning model comparison and ii) dataset adequacy evaluation. In addition, our findings not only promise a more complete identification of trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy and robustness but can also help researchers optimize their efforts in data collection by identifying the less robust and more challenging class labels.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The True Boundedness Model (TBM) is a robustness metric that can be used to compare the true robustness of models for real-world datasets.

Comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children. Bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms. The most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways. The relatively greater deficits observed in the older children, on the other hand, suggest that sensorimotor functions come to depend more extensively on contralateral pathways as the corpus callosum reaches functional maturity.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The well-preserved tactile information of the children tested here is remarkable. They were given a direct comparison to their more aged peers, who are typically 6 to 16 years old. The results support the idea that, at least in the young children, there is a relatively less severe interruption of callosal transmission of tactile information than in the older children, suggesting that

The direct effect on stimulated SA production of pre-incubating cells with prednisolone in vitro was also studied. Significant inhibition of monocyte SA output stimulated with IgG-treated zymosan (ITZ) and fluoride ion (F), but not serum-treated zymosan (STZ) was demonstrated following steroid therapy in RA. No inhibitory effect of prednisolone could be demonstrated in vitro, using ITZ, STZ and F as stimuli. Our data on blood monocyte yields, size and cytochemistry suggest that the in vivo effect is due to a shift in blood monocyte traffic.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Studies on the direct and indirect effects of steroid therapy on the stimulated state of pre-incubated cells with prednisol One in vitro suggest that the in vivo effects are based on a shift in blood monocytes traffic.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Convert a disfluent question to a proper question. A disfluent question is a question that has some interruptions in it while framing. A proper question is the correct form of the question without any disfluency.<n><n>### Input:<n>How many bits are thought to be a hard problem oops are often in the primes used for RSA public key cryptography algorithms?<n><n>### Response:<n>		The number of bits needed to compute a public key is 8, but the values 8 and 16 aren't necessarily prime numbers. Consider the following two example queries:<n><n>A/B = 3, Alice = 2, Bob = 1<n><n>The answer to both queries is 3.<n><n>The trick is that the first two terms define a proper question. In the first example, the question is "how many bits is it?" and "Alice" is a proper question, because Bob is a proper question.<n><n>The third question, "B", is actually the same as the previous two questions but it uses the word "b" instead of "a". Thus, it's a legitimate question!

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Decentralized POMDPs provide an expressive framework for multi-agent sequential decision making. While finite-horizon DECPOMDPs have enjoyed significant success, progress remains slow for the infinite-horizon case mainly due to the inherent complexity of optimizing stochastic controllers representing agent policies. We present a promising new class of algorithms for the infinite-horizon case, which recasts the optimization problem as inference in a mixture of DBNs. An attractive feature of this approach is the straightforward adoption of existing inference techniques in DBNs for solving DEC-POMDPs and supporting richer representations such as factored or continuous states and actions. We also derive the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize the joint policy represented as DBNs. Experiments on benchmark domains show that EM compares favorably against the state-of-the-art solvers.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The proposed class of algorithms for the unlimited-horizon case, Recasts the optimization problem as an inference in a mixture of

Using current data from seven sources new reference curves have been estimated from birth to 20 years for children in 1990. The great majority of the data are nationally representative. The analysis used Cole's LMS method and has produced efficient estimates of the conventional centiles and gives a good fit to the data.

Distinct from previous work, our approach employs context-dependent word-level attention for more accurate statement representations and question-guided sentence-level attention for better context modeling. Employing these mechanisms, our model accurately understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a supplementary question for additional input. When available, user’s feedback is encoded and directly applied to update sentence-level attention to infer the answer. Extensive experiments on QA and IQA datasets demonstrate quantitatively the effectiveness of our model with significant improvement over conventional QA models.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The following are considered to be preferred headlines for this text: “New Model Develops New Intelligent Question Language (IQA) Software.”, “Developing a New Model for Interactive Question Answitting (IQA) Software”, and “New Genome of Intelligence Unveils a New Edge in Science.”.

Unfortunately, researchers working in this paradigm have re­ stricted much of their attention to rather sim­ ple representations of belief states, namely logically closed sets of propositional sen­ tences. In our opinion, this has resulted in a too abstract categorisation of belief change operations: expansion, revision, or contrac­ tion. Occasionally, in the AGM paradigm, also probabilistic belief changes have been considered, and it is widely accepted that the probabilistic version of expansion is con­ ditioning. However, we argue that it may be more correct to view conditioning and expan­ sion as two essentially different kinds of belief change, and that what we call constraining is a better candidate for being considered prob­ abilistic expansion.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The AGM model of belief revision has re-shaped our view of how to categorise belief changes. The most cited re-versions include:<n>- Belief causes revision.

This problem may be even worse for postgraduate students who are new to a field and may not know where to start. To address this problem, we have developed an online catalog of research papers where the papers have been automatically categorized by a topic model. The catalog contains 7719 papers from the proceedings of two artificial intelligence conferences from 2000 to 2015. Rather than the commonly used Latent Dirichlet Allocation, we use a recently proposed method called hierarchical latent tree analysis for topic modeling. The resulting topic model contains a hierarchy of topics so that users can browse the topics from the top level to the bottom level. The topic model contains a manageable number of general topics at the top level and allows thousands of fine-grained topics at the bottom level. It also can detect topics that have emerged recently.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here is a sample topic model for a University Research Paper Catalog:<n><n>Here is a related topic model for an Artificial Intelligence Conference (AI Conference):<n><n>Here is a sample article from the Wall Street Journal:<n><n>Artificial Intelligence, which many years ago was the domain of university researchers, is peopled with professors and journalists whose conferences this year have attracted many high-level attendees, including Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, CNET, and dozens of others.

As the New York Times put it, "the debate rages on, each year, because the issues have different champions."

While essential object detection ingredients such as features, classifiers, and proposal methods have been extensively researched surprisingly little work has aimed to systematically address NMS. The de-facto standard for NMS is based on greedy clustering with a fixed distance threshold, which forces to trade-off recall versus precision. We propose a convnet designed to perform NMS of a given set of detections. We report experiments on a synthetic setup, and results on crowded pedestrian detection scenes. Our approach overcomes the intrinsic limitations of greedy NMS, obtaining better recall and precision.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Under 15 words, the output of this text could be: "A non-maximizing suppression (NMS)  is used in virtually all State-of-the-Art object detection pipelines."

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>In this paper, we investigate whether an a priori disambiguation of word senses is strictly necessary or whether the meaning of a word in context can be disambiguated through composition alone. We evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf singlevector and multi-sense vector models on a benchmark phrase similarity task and a novel task for word-sense discrimination. We find that single-sense vector models perform as well or better than multi-sense vector models despite arguably less clean elementary representations. Our findings furthermore show that simple composition functions such as pointwise addition are able to recover sense specific information from a single-sense vector model remark-<n><n>### Response:<n>		The a priori disambiguous  method for word-sense discrimination looks like this: find  word which is similar to the phrase "be careful" and similarly word which cannot be similar to the phrase "look carefully" (a priori).

Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In obese individuals, adipose tissue releases increased amounts of non-esterified fatty acids, glycerol, hormones, pro-inflammatory cytokines and other factors that are involved in the development of insulin resistance. When insulin resistance is accompanied by dysfunction of pancreatic islet β-cells — the cells that release insulin — failure to control blood glucose levels results. Abnormalities in β-cell function are therefore critical in defining the risk and development of type 2 diabetes. This knowledge is fostering exploration of the molecular and genetic basis of the disease and new approaches to its treatment and prevention.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Journalism Bioscience

In reality, before a new order can be put into production, a series of activities known as pre-production events need to be completed. In addition, in real production process, owing to various uncertainties, the daily production quantity of each order is not always as expected. In this research, by considering the pre-production events and the uncertainties in the daily production quantity, robust order scheduling problems in the fashion industry are investigated with the aid of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) called nondominated sorting adaptive differential evolution (NSJADE). The experimental results illustrate that it is of paramount importance to consider pre-production events in order scheduling problems in the fashion industry. We also unveil that the existence of the uncertainties in the daily production quantity heavily affects the order scheduling.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Producers assign production orders to produceables in a series of activities knownas pre-production events. These activities need to be completed before the order can be put into development.

We were unable to show any abnormality in the excretion of Zn, Mg or GAG. In 11 patients, a low level of urinary citrate was a significant feature that was associated in most cases with a urinary pH value above 6. Citrate concentration (per litre) and output (per 24 h) were found to be lower than in the controls in 19 and 33% respectively of the determinations. The overall ratio of average urinary citrate concentration in patients and controls was 0.56, a figure in agreement with previous data.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The excretion of four inhibitors  of urinary stone formation was studied in 20 normal healthy controls and 40 recurrent calcium formers who were placed in a fixed diet restricted in sodium, oxalates and Purines.
