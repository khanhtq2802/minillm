First, it is important to understand what a stem cell is. Stem cells are cells that have the capability of becoming any other type of cell in the body, as well as of growing into mature tissues and organs. stem cells are also a type of tissue in the body, which means they carry out specialized functions that are essential for their survival. Examples of stem cells include skin, blood, bone marrow, and fat. When these stem cells are damaged or removed, they often die, but they may also return to life through different mechanisms. In some cases, such as bladders, they line the urinary system as a result of being able to re-enter the bloodstream. Another example is an immune system cell that can return to the site of a injury and repair any damage it has caused. So stem cells are important not just for creating tissue in the body, but also for maintaining its health and functions.<n><n>Once you have an idea of what the article is about, you can generate a title by taking a look at some generic words that describe what the article is about. For example, some words that could be used are "ha

DNA vaccines are currently used in veterinary medicine, but have not achieved widespread acceptance for use in humans due to their low immunogenicity in early clinical studies. However, recent clinical data have re-established the value of DNA vaccines, particularly in priming high-level antigenspecific antibody responses. Several approaches have been investigated for improving DNA vaccine efficacy, including advancements in DNA vaccine vector design, the inclusion of genetically engineered cytokine adjuvants, and novel non-mechanical delivery methods. These strategies have shown promise, resulting in augmented adaptive immune responses in not only mice, but also in large animal models. Here, we review advancements in each of these areas that show promise for increasing the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Title: "DNA Vaccines Enhance Immunity Through a High-Level Antigen Specific IgG Response"

These cases are unusual in that renal metastases are usually silent lesions discovered at autopsy. Review of the autopsy data from this hospital identified renal metastases in 19% of patients who died from carcinoma of the lung. This incidence parallels that of other series. A solid renal lesion which is identified in a patient with a history of pulmonary carcinoma should raise the suspicion of renal metastases, especially if computed tomography of the mass demonstrates relative homogeneity and minimal enhancement. More frequent use of the abdominal CT scan in staging patients with lung cancer will render metastatic carcinoma from lung to kidney a more frequent ante mortem diagnosis.<n><n>### Response:<n>		A solid renal lesion whichis identified in a patient witha history of pulmonary carcinoma will raise the suspicion of renal neoplasms, especially if computed tomographic of the mass reveals relative homogeneity and minimal impairment.

Here we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models. We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected. We estimate how transmission parameters varied through time, highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species. Predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of GB are presented for the fitted models.<n><n>### Response:<n>		A title like "The Geographic Structure of the 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease Epidemic in Great Britain" would be a good choice under 100 words.

This dynamic structure physically connects neighboring epithelial cells, couples intercellular adhesive contacts to the cytoskeleton, and helps define each cell's apical-basal axis. Together these activities coordinate the form, polarity, and function of all cells in an epithelium. Several molecules regulate AJ formation and integrity, including Rho family GTPases and Par polarity proteins. However, only recently, with the development of live-cell imaging, has the extent to which E-cadherin is actively turned over at junctions begun to be appreciated. This turnover contributes to junction formation and to the maintenance of epithelial integrity during tissue homeostasis and remodeling.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The epithelial CADHELIN complex binds to cytoskeleton and regulatory and signaling molecules, and creates a mature adherenses junction (AJ).

At each timestep, zoneout stochastically forces some hidden units to maintain their previous values. Like dropout, zoneout uses random noise to train a pseudo-ensemble, improving generalization. But by preserving instead of dropping hidden units, gradient information and state information are more readily propagated through time, as in feedforward stochastic depth networks. We perform an empirical investigation of various RNN regularizers, and find encouraging results: zoneout gives significant performance improvements across tasks, yielding state-ofthe-art results in character-level language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset and competitive results on word-level Penn Treebank and permuted sequential MNIST classification tasks.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We propose zone out, a novel method for Regularizing RNNs.

To make encoder-decoder models more flexible, attention mechanism was introduced to machine translation and also other tasks like speech recognition and image captioning. We observe that the quality of translation by attention-based encoder-decoder can be significantly damaged when the alignment is incorrect. We attribute these problems to the lack of distortion and fertility models. Aiming to resolve these problems, we propose new variations of attention-based encoderdecoder and compare them with other models on machine translation. Our proposed method achieved an improvement of 2 BLEU points over the original attentionbased encoder-decoder.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here are the headlines you are given:<n><n>1.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Recently deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to learn speaker features. However, the quality of the learned features is not sufficiently good, so a complex back-end model, either neural or probabilistic, has to be used to address the residual uncertainty when applied to speaker verification, just as with raw features. This paper presents a convolutional timedelay deep neural network structure (CT-DNN) for speaker feature learning. Our experimental results on the Fisher database demonstrated that this CT-DNN can produce highquality speaker features: even with a single feature (0.3 seconds including the context), the EER can be as low as 7.68%. This effectively confirmed that the speaker trait is largely a deterministic short-time property rather than a long-time distributional pattern, and therefore can be extracted from just dozens of frames.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Speaker features are often difficult to extract from a large amount of video. This paper presents a CT-DNN system that can generate high-quality speaker features using only a few frames.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Matrix factorization (MF) and Autoencoder (AE) are among the most successful approaches of unsupervised learning. While MF based models have been extensively exploited in the graph modeling and link prediction literature, the AE family has not gained much attention. In this paper we investigate both MF and AE’s application to the link prediction problem in sparse graphs. We show the connection between AE and MF from the perspective of multiview learning, and further propose MF+AE: a model training MF and AE jointly with shared parameters. We apply dropout to training both the MF and AE parts, and show that it can significantly prevent overfitting by acting as an adaptive regularization. We conduct experiments on six real world sparse graph datasets, and show that MF+AE consistently outperforms the competing methods, especially on datasets that demonstrate strong non-cohesive structures.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here is a part of the article to generate the headline for this text:<n><n>Link Prediction Problems in Sparse Graphs: Use Both MF and AE<n><n>Use both MF and AE

Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>T cell activation is predicated on the interaction between the T cell receptor and peptide-major histocompatibility (pMHC) ligands. The factors that determine the stimulatory potency of a pMHC molecule remain unclear. We describe results showing that a peptide exhibiting many hallmarks of a weak agonist stimulates T cells to proliferate more than the wild-type agonist ligand. An in silico approach suggested that the inability to form the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) could underlie the increased proliferation. This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed that enhancing cSMAC formation reduced stimulatory capacity of the weak peptide. Our studies highlight the fact that a complex interplay of factors determines the quality of a T cell antigen.<n><n>### Response:<n>		A peptide with many hallmarks of aweak agonist stimulates T cellsto proliferate more than thewild-type agonist ligands.

We compiled several relevant and appropriate requirement quality attributes and sentence rules from previous literatures and adopt it to come out with a set of ambiguity attributes that most suit Malay words. The extracted Malay ambiguous words (potential) are then being mapped onto the constructed ambiguity attributes to confirm their vagueness. The list is then verified by Malay linguist experts. This paper aims to identify a list of potential ambiguous words in Malay as an attempt to assist writers to avoid using the vague words while documenting Malay Requirement Specification as well as to any other related Malay documentation. The result of this study is a list of 120 potential ambiguous Malay words that could act as guidelines in writing Malay sentences.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here is a potential list of Malay words that could be used to construct a headline:<n><n>1.

The fundamental reason is the difficulty of backpropagation through discrete random variables combined with the inherent instability of the GAN training objective. To address these problems, we propose Maximum-Likelihood Augmented Discrete Generative Adversarial Networks. Instead of directly optimizing the GAN objective, we derive a novel and low-variance objective using the discriminator’s output that follows corresponds to the log-likelihood. Compared with the original, the new objective is proved to be consistent in theory and beneficial in practice. The experimental results on various discrete datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The article presents data and you are given the task to generate the headlines.

You then need to calculate the probability that the number itself is composite, which can be computed by dividing the sum of the probabilities of each number separately. In order to do this, you can first transform the disfluent question to have a proper question, as follows:<n><n>When using a prob alistic test, oh noI mean primality, how Is the probability that the number  is composite expressed mathematically?,<n><n>So the proper question here is:<n>When using a Prob alistic test, oh yes I mean primality, what is the probability that the actual number is composite?<n><n>The proper question is quite easy to formulate, considering that we know the actual number and only need to calculate the probability of it being composite. To do this, we can first collect all the information needed about the number and its composite representation. When preparing the question, we can either collect all the knowledge about the number itself or just a portion of it depending on how deep the disfluent question goes. Once we have all the knowledge, we can transform the disfluent information to a proper question:<n><n>When using prob alistic test, o no I

However, much is unknown about mechanisms which can give rise to coherent oscillatory behavior, with few exceptions (e.g., explicitly delayed self-repressors and simple models of specific organisms' circadian clocks). We present what may be the simplest possible reliable gene network oscillator, a self-repressing gene. We show that binding cooperativity, which has not been considered in detail in this context, can combine with small numbers of intermediate steps to create coherent oscillation. We also note that noise blurs the line between oscillatory and non-oscillatory behavior.<n><n>### Response:<n>		A self-repressing gene may be a good title for the research paper.

If they don't receive the applications by then, they can't start issuing licenses until the following Saturday, Aug. 20. "This is a huge milestone for mango lovers around the country," said Maria Gonzalez, a Miami-based community activist who has been crusading for the right to sell mangoes online. "This will give small-time grocers a chance to get their products out in the marketplace, where consumers will be able to buy them directly from the grocers without the need for a middleman like a restaurant or supermarket." Although local governments will be responsible for issuing licenses to the grocers, online buyers will be able to filter the list of approved grocers through a single application. The new rule is a win for small business owners, who have long been frustrated by the requirement to trek to distant farms and buy mangoes on

The most popular restaurant in Delhi, for example, is Kedarnath Cafe, where the ambiance and decor bear a striking resemblance to that of an Indian ashram. The eating experience, however, is considerably more expensive than most restaurants in India. Kedarnath Cafe attempts to fit all of India within a 500 km radius, hence the Rs. 30,000 per person entry fee. While it is unlikely that a typical visitor will spend more than this on a single visit, the limited choices and stiff service force patrons to spend more. The cafe also doesn't offer a wide variety of menu options, with only a few options being offered for every type of cuisine. <n><n>For this reason, it is also difficult to recommend Kedarnath Cafe as a place to go for a meal. Rather, it is better to go to a restaurant that focuses on providing quality food at a reasonable price. An example of this would be Golden Kopps, which is run by a Portuguese family and claims to be the oldest Kopps in Delhi. The ambiance,

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>State-space models are successfully used in many areas of science, engineering and economics to model time series and dynamical systems. We present a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning (i.e. state estimation and system identification) in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. We place a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, resulting in a flexible model able to capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efficient inference, we marginalize over the transition dynamics function and infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using specially tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution can be formulated analytically. Our approach preserves the full nonparametric expressivity of the model and can make use of sparse Gaussian processes to greatly reduce computational complexity.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here is a list of suggested headlines:<n>1.

Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Air pollution is a heterogeneous, complex mixture of gases, liquids, and particulate matter. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a consistent increased risk for cardiovascular events in relation to both short- and long-term exposure to present-day concentrations of ambient particulate matter. Several plausible mechanistic pathways have been described, including enhanced coagulation/thrombosis, a propensity for arrhythmias, acute arterial vasoconstriction, systemic inflammatory responses, and the chronic promotion of atherosclerosis. The purpose of this statement is to provide healthcare professionals and regulatory agencies with a comprehensive review of the literature on air pollution and cardiovascular disease. In addition, the implications of these findings in relation to public health and regulatory policies are addressed. Practical recommendations for healthcare providers and their patients are outlined. In the final section, suggestions for future research are made to address a number of remaining scientific questions.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Air pollution is amply associated with cardiovascular diseases, which are evident even at low doses. The literature on the subject is extensive, and replies to the questions posed here are comprehensive. Below is a brief summary of the key points made:<n><n>1. A heterogeneous mixture of gases, liquids and particulate matter is responsible for most adverse cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular events such as angina and heart failure.<n>2. Therefore, inhaling air with higher amounts of oxidants, such as sulfur dioxide, mean more adverse cardiovascular effects.<n>3. The mechanisms behind the association between air pollution and cardiovascular diseases are not fully understood, but some plausible ones include enhanced coagulation/Thrombosis, a tendency for arrhythmias and acute arterial vasoconstantration, systemic inflammation and the chronic promotion ofatherosclerosis.<n>4. Despite the promising results of some interventions, such as limiting exposure to toxic pollutants, increasing exercise level or smoking cessation, the available evidence is not enough to draw definitive conclusions.<n><n>The authors also provided some suggestions for future research:<n>1. To better understand the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, clinicians and regulatory agencies need to focus on a comprehensive review of the extant literature.<n>2. To strengthen the evidence base,

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Colorization of grayscale images has been a hot topic in computer vision. Previous research mainly focuses on producing a colored image to match the original one. However, since many colors share the same gray value, an input grayscale image could be diversely colored while maintaining its reality. In this paper, we design a novel solution for unsupervised diverse colorization. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative adversarial networks to model the distribution of real-world item colors, in which we develop a fully convolutional generator with multi-layer noise to enhance diversity, with multi-layer condition concatenation to maintain reality, and with stride 1 to keep spatial information. With such a novel network architecture, the model yields highly competitive performance on the open LSUN bedroom dataset. The Turing test of 80 humans further indicates our generated color schemes are highly convincible.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here is a list of options that can be used for headlines generation:<n><n>- Title of the article<n>- Author of the article<n>- URL of the article<n>- Color of the article <n>- Author of the book <n>- Number of pages in the book

We develop a robustness metric derived from source-aware lower and upper bounds of model accuracy even when data source labels are not readily available. We clearly demonstrate that even on a well-explored dataset like MNIST, challenging training scenarios can be constructed under the proposed assessment framework for two separate yet equally important applications: i) more rigorous learning model comparison and ii) dataset adequacy evaluation. In addition, our findings not only promise a more complete identification of trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy and robustness but can also help researchers optimize their efforts in data collection by identifying the less robust and more challenging class labels.<n><n>### Response:<n>		This article introduces a novel validation framework to measured the true robustness of Learning Models for Real-World Applications.  The framework is based on source-inclusive and source-exclusive partitions in a dataset via hierarchical clustering.

While there is no universal consensus on the exact definition of morality, it is widely accepted that justice should be based on what is objectively right. When a judge evaluates a case solely on what is right, they are not focusing on the judge's own sense of morality, but on the justice that is objective under the law. By not focusing on morality, a judge can more easily focus on the issues in the case and ensure that they are acting in the best interests of the people they are trying to help.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.<n><n>### Input:<n>Abstract: Five children, aged 6 to 16 years, were tested for unilateral discrimination and interhemispheric transfer of tactile information as well as tactuomotor learning at various intervals before and after therapeutic callosotomy. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children. Bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms. The most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways. The relatively greater deficits observed in the older children, on the other hand, suggest that sensorimotor functions come to depend more extensively on contralateral pathways as the corpus callosum reaches functional maturity.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The key focus of the paper is bilateral discrimination and interhemispherical transfer of tactile information as shown in the abstract.

The number of bits needed to solve a problem is related to the input and the problem space. Usually the number of bits is abbreviated as b.B for short. For example, the number of bits needed to compute the private key of a RSA public key cryptosystem is b^2. While this number is large, it is only wants a few specialized hardware options and it is called a hard problem. Another example with similar structure is the number of bits needed compute the square of a number. Now multiply both numbers together to get b^2/b.B. Now multiply by another number, this time b, which is the number of bits required to compute the square of the number. This last number is called a minimum number of bits needed to lower the square of the number oops.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We propose a simple, scalable, fully generative model for transition-based dependency parsing with high accuracy. The model, parameterized by Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Processes, overcomes the limitations of previous generative models by allowing fast and accurate inference. We propose an efficient decoding algorithm based on particle filtering that can adapt the beam size to the uncertainty in the model while jointly predicting POS tags and parse trees. The UAS of the parser is on par with that of a greedy discriminative baseline. As a language model, it obtains better perplexity than a n-gram model by performing semi-supervised learning over a large unlabelled corpus. We show that the model is able to generate locally and syntactically coherent sentences, opening the door to further applications in language generation.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here is a part of the article you are given: <n><n>• Transitions-Based Dependency Parsing Using Strong Bayesian Inference<n>• Hierarchical Pitman–Yor Processes<n>• Fast and accurate inference

While finite-horizon DECPOMDPs have enjoyed significant success, progress remains slow for the infinite-horizon case mainly due to the inherent complexity of optimizing stochastic controllers representing agent policies. We present a promising new class of algorithms for the infinite-horizon case, which recasts the optimization problem as inference in a mixture of DBNs. An attractive feature of this approach is the straightforward adoption of existing inference techniques in DBNs for solving DEC-POMDPs and supporting richer representations such as factored or continuous states and actions. We also derive the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize the joint policy represented as DBNs. Experiments on benchmark domains show that EM compares favorably against the state-of-the-art solvers.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here you are given a partted article and your goal is to generate the headline for this text.

Distinct from previous work, our approach employs context-dependent word-level attention for more accurate statement representations and question-guided sentence-level attention for better context modeling. Employing these mechanisms, our model accurately understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a supplementary question for additional input. When available, user’s feedback is encoded and directly applied to update sentence-level attention to infer the answer. Extensive experiments on QA and IQA datasets demonstrate quantitatively the effectiveness of our model with significant improvement over conventional QA models.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We develop a model for Interactive Question AnSWering (IQA) using GatedRecurrent Unit recurrent networks (GRUs).

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>The AGM theory of belief revision has be­ come an important paradigm for investigat­ ing rational belief changes. Unfortunately, researchers working in this paradigm have re­ stricted much of their attention to rather sim­ ple representations of belief states, namely logically closed sets of propositional sen­ tences. In our opinion, this has resulted in a too abstract categorisation of belief change operations: expansion, revision, or contrac­ tion. Occasionally, in the AGM paradigm, also probabilistic belief changes have been considered, and it is widely accepted that the probabilistic version of expansion is con­ ditioning. However, we argue that it may be more correct to view conditioning and expan­ sion as two essentially different kinds of belief change, and that what we call constraining is a better candidate for being considered prob­ abilistic expansion.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The AGM model has become an important paradigme for explor­ing rational belief changes. Unfortunately research has predominantly focused on more realistic build­ings, such as logical closed sets of propositions. While this has resulted in a much more abstract concept of belief change, it has also resulted in a lack of understanding of how different belief change operations would be defined in the real world.

Standard label propagation fails to consider the properties of the label types and the interactions between them. Our proposed method, called EDGEEXPLAIN, explicitly models these, while still enabling scalable inference under a distributed message-passing architecture. On a billion-node subset of the Facebook social network, EDGEEXPLAIN significantly outperforms label propagation for several label types, with lifts of up to 120% for recall@1 and 60% for recall@3.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We tackle the problems of inferring node labels and then we see how EDGEEXPLAIN model able to perform better than standard label propagation.

This problem may be even worse for postgraduate students who are new to a field and may not know where to start. To address this problem, we have developed an online catalog of research papers where the papers have been automatically categorized by a topic model. The catalog contains 7719 papers from the proceedings of two artificial intelligence conferences from 2000 to 2015. Rather than the commonly used Latent Dirichlet Allocation, we use a recently proposed method called hierarchical latent tree analysis for topic modeling. The resulting topic model contains a hierarchy of topics so that users can browse the topics from the top level to the bottom level. The topic model contains a manageable number of general topics at the top level and allows thousands of fine-grained topics at the bottom level. It also can detect topics that have emerged recently.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here is a possible headline for this text: Academic researchers often need to face With a large collection of research articles in the literature.

The type II prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas adaptive immune system has been shown to facilitate RNA-guided site-specific DNA cleavage. We engineered two different type II CRISPR/Cas systems and demonstrate that Cas9 nucleases can be directed by short RNAs to induce precise cleavage at endogenous genomic loci in human and mouse cells. Cas9 can also be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with minimal mutagenic activity. Lastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided nuclease technology.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Functional eluculation of causal genetic variants and Elements requires precise genome editing technologies

While essential object detection ingredients such as features, classifiers, and proposal methods have been extensively researched surprisingly little work has aimed to systematically address NMS.

We propose a convnet designed to perform NMS of a given set of detections. We report experiments on a synthetic setup, and results on crowded pedestrian detection scenes. Our approach overcomes the intrinsic limitations of greedy NMS, obtaining better recall and precision.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here is a list of headlines that can be generated for this text:<n><n>- "Parking tickets surge as London mayor prepares to axe tickets"<n>- "Bus driver catches fire as he fights flames while driving his bus"<n>- "Second suspect in Oxford student attack arrested"<n>- "Man with dual citizenship arrested in Turkey"

However, so far no drug against HIV-1 infection exhibiting this mechanism of action has been approved. To identify new potent candidates for inhibitors, we performed in silico screening of a commercial database of more than 1,300 drug-like compounds by using receptorbased docking studies. The candidates selected from docking studies were subsequently tested using biological assays to assess anti-HIV activities. As a result, two compounds were identified as the most active. Specifically, both exhibited anti-HIV activity against viral replication at a low concentration and relatively low cytotoxicity at the effective concentration inhibiting viral growth by 50 %.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Title: Cyclophilin A has been recently discovered as a new anti-human immunodepression virus type 1 (Hiv-1) drug.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>In the fashion industry, order scheduling focuses on the assignment of production orders to appropriate production lines. In reality, before a new order can be put into production, a series of activities known as pre-production events need to be completed. In addition, in real production process, owing to various uncertainties, the daily production quantity of each order is not always as expected. In this research, by considering the pre-production events and the uncertainties in the daily production quantity, robust order scheduling problems in the fashion industry are investigated with the aid of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) called nondominated sorting adaptive differential evolution (NSJADE). The experimental results illustrate that it is of paramount importance to consider pre-production events in order scheduling problems in the fashion industry. We also unveil that the existence of the uncertainties in the daily production quantity heavily affects the order scheduling.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The title of the article is "In the fashion industry, pre-production events matter more than production quantities."

We were unable to show any abnormality in the excretion of Zn, Mg or GAG. In 11 patients, a low level of urinary citrate was a significant feature that was associated in most cases with a urinary pH value above 6. Citrate concentration (per litre) and output (per 24 h) were found to be lower than in the controls in 19 and 33% respectively of the determinations. The overall ratio of average urinary citrate concentration in patients and controls was 0.56, a figure in agreement with previous data.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The excretion of four inhibitors Of Urine Stone Forming was Study in 20 normal controls and40 recurrences calcium stone formers were placed on a fixed diets restricted in calcium, oxalis and purines.
