DNA vaccines are currently used in veterinary medicine, but have not achieved widespread acceptance for use in humans due to their low immunogenicity in early clinical studies. However, recent clinical data have re-established the value of DNA vaccines, particularly in priming high-level antigenspecific antibody responses. Several approaches have been investigated for improving DNA vaccine efficacy, including advancements in DNA vaccine vector design, the inclusion of genetically engineered cytokine adjuvants, and novel non-mechanical delivery methods. These strategies have shown promise, resulting in augmented adaptive immune responses in not only mice, but also in large animal models. Here, we review advancements in each of these areas that show promise for increasing the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines.<n><n>### Response:<n>		DNA vaccines are currently used in animal medicine, but have not reached widespread acceptance for use in human trials due to their low immunigenicity.

Reports so far suggest that it is a progressive or at least a stationary condition. There are no detailed reports on recommended therapy. A prospective clinical study was conducted to show regression of LK following extracapsular cataract extraction. Seventeen black patients (26 eyes) with LK and mature cataracts underwent extracapsular cataract extraction. The severity of the LK was recorded photographically pre- and postoperatively. The follow-up ranged from 6 to fifteen months. Twenty-four eyes (92%) showed regression of the LK. The reduction in exposure to ultraviolet light as a result of aphakic photophobia could be one of the factors which have led to the regression of the LK.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The paper's key focus is on the relationship between solar radiation exposure and Labrador keratopathy (LCK). The study reports that patients with LK have a reduced ability to detect sunlight and consequently have a gradual progression of the disease.

Fifty one subjects with altered levels of consciousness were studied. Of these, 23 patients were known diabetics, and 28 were not diabetic. The change in glucose level for the total study group ranged from a low of 37 mg/dl to a high of 370 mg/dl, with a mean of 166 +/- 77 mg/dl. The mean for the diabetic and non-diabetic groups were 177 +/- 80 mg/dl and 154 +/- 75 mg/dl. These results suggest that serum glucose levels cannot be quantitatively predicted after a single intravenous bolus of D-50.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The rise in serum glucose level is not quantitatively predicted after a bolus of 50 ml dextrose solution in the emergency department.

Responses to supramaximal stimuli of the ulnar nerves were measured by a force transducer, and compared with visually observed movements of the contralateral thumb. For the 10 patients anaesthetized with nitrous oxide and enflurane, the second, third and fourth twitches visually reappeared at 84 (+/- 10)%, 76 (+/- 11)%, and 70 (+/- 12)% measured blockade, respectively. For the other 10 patients, anaesthetized with a narcotic-barbiturate technique, the second, third and fourth twitches reappeared at 81 (+/- 8)%, 68 (+/- 9)%, and 59 (+/- 11)%. These results were not different for the two anaesthetic techniques.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Train-of-four recovery is a neuropsychiatric disorder in which patients are given a valium, and are given a series of three tests to determine if they are able to return to their normal behavior. The first test is a force transducer; the second is a visual stimulus, and the third is a response to the visual stimulus. In this study, we compared the measured responses of the ulnar nerves with the visual stimuli. We found that the two anaesthetic techniques were similar, but the third twitches were visually observed.

These cases are unusual in that renal metastases are usually silent lesions discovered at autopsy. Review of the autopsy data from this hospital identified renal metastases in 19% of patients who died from carcinoma of the lung. This incidence parallels that of other series. A solid renal lesion which is identified in a patient with a history of pulmonary carcinoma should raise the suspicion of renal metastases, especially if computed tomography of the mass demonstrates relative homogeneity and minimal enhancement. More frequent use of the abdominal CT scan in staging patients with lung cancer will render metastatic carcinoma from lung to kidney a more frequent ante mortem diagnosis.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The case of clinically manifest solitary and unilateral renal lesions metastatic from a lung are presented.

Under 100 words is a good title length.<n><n>### Input:<n>Despite intensive ongoing research, key aspects of the spatial-temporal evolution of the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in Great Britain (GB) remain unexplained. Here we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models. We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected.

This observation does not invalidate the concept of functional groupings within these anterior horn cell pools. In studies of the same segment in cords obtained at autopsy from patients with motor neuron disease, zones of focal loss of motor neurons were identified, without consistent severity or distribution at different sectional levels. These findings imply varying resistance to the disease in different pools of motor neurons.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In a three-dimensional study on the distribution of anterior horn cell groups in the C8 segment, we have recognized lateral and median zones of motor neuron grouping, but have not been capable of recognizing subgroups of neurons within those groups resembling the anatomical columns described earlier.

This dynamic structure physically connects neighboring epithelial cells, couples intercellular adhesive contacts to the cytoskeleton, and helps define each cell's apical-basal axis. Together these activities coordinate the form, polarity, and function of all cells in an epithelium. Several molecules regulate AJ formation and integrity, including Rho family GTPases and Par polarity proteins.

Mapping such syntactic variants into semantic concepts that can be understood by robots is challenging due to the high flexibility of natural language expressions. To tackle this problem, we collect robotic commands for navigation and manipulation tasks using crowdsourcing. We further define a robot language and use a generative machine translation model to translate robotic commands from natural language to robot language. The main purpose of this paper is to simulate the interaction process between human and robots using crowdsourcing platforms, and investigate the possibility of translating natural language to robot language with paraphrases.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Robotic commands typically contain spatial descriptions that are semantic similar but syntactically distinct.

At each timestep, zoneout stochastically forces some hidden units to maintain their previous values. Like dropout, zoneout uses random noise to train a pseudo-ensemble, improving generalization. But by preserving instead of dropping hidden units, gradient information and state information are more readily propagated through time, as in feedforward stochastic depth networks. We perform an empirical investigation of various RNN regularizers, and find encouraging results: zoneout gives significant performance improvements across tasks, yielding state-ofthe-art results in character-level language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset and competitive results on word-level Penn Treebank and permuted sequential MNIST classification tasks.<n><n>### Response:<n>		zoneout regularizes the network output by randomly varying the hidden units.

To make encoder-decoder models more flexible, attention mechanism was introduced to machine translation and also other tasks like speech recognition and image captioning.

We attribute these problems to the lack of distortion and fertility models. Aiming to resolve these problems, we propose new variations of attention-based encoderdecoder and compare them with other models on machine translation. Our proposed method achieved an improvement of 2 BLEU points over the original attentionbased encoder-decoder.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Neural machine translations have shown very promising results lately, especially for speech recognition and image captionation.

However, the quality of the learned features is not sufficiently good, so a complex back-end model, either neural or probabilistic, has to be used to address the residual uncertainty when applied to speaker verification, just as with raw features. This paper presents a convolutional timedelay deep neural network structure (CT-DNN) for speaker feature learning. Our experimental results on the Fisher database demonstrated that this CT-DNN can produce highquality speaker features: even with a single feature (0.3 seconds including the context), the EER can be as low as 7.68%. This effectively confirmed that the speaker trait is largely a deterministic short-time property rather than a long-time distributional pattern, and therefore can be extracted from just dozens of frames.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Recently deep neural network (DNN) have been used to train speaker features. However, while the quality of the learned feature is not sufficiently good, a complex back-end network, either neural or probablistic, has to be utilized to address the residual uncertainty, just as with raw feature. This paper presents a novel structure for training a convolutional timedELay neural network for speaker feature learning. This new structure can be extracted from a handful of frames, providing a high quality representative of the actual speaker.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Matrix factorization (MF) and Autoencoder (AE) are among the most successful approaches of unsupervised learning. While MF based models have been extensively exploited in the graph modeling and link prediction literature, the AE family has not gained much attention. In this paper we investigate both MF and AE’s application to the link prediction problem in sparse graphs. We show the connection between AE and MF from the perspective of multiview learning, and further propose MF+AE: a model training MF and AE jointly with shared parameters. We apply dropout to training both the MF and AE parts, and show that it can significantly prevent overfitting by acting as an adaptive regularization. We conduct experiments on six real world sparse graph datasets, and show that MF+AE consistently outperforms the competing methods, especially on datasets that demonstrate strong non-cohesive structures.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The following are the preferred headlines for this text:<n>“Link Prediction Problem in Sparse Graphs”<n>“Autoencoder and Matrix Factorization”<n>“Link Prediction Problems with Shallow Graphs”

Under 100 words is a good title length.<n><n>### Input:<n>The basic reproduction number R 0 is one of the most important concepts in modern infectious disease epidemiology. However, for more realistic and more complex models than those assuming homogeneous mixing in the population, other threshold quantities can be defined that are sometimes more useful and easily derived in terms of model parameters. In this paper, we present a model for the spread of a permanently immunizing infection in a population socially structured into households and workplaces/schools, and we propose and discuss a new household-to-household reproduction number R H for it. We show how R H overcomes some of the limitations of a previously proposed threshold parameter, and we highlight its relationship with the effort required to control an epidemic when interventions are targeted at randomly selected households.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The research paper you are reading describes a model for the spread-of-an-immunizing infection in a population of randomly selected households and workplaces. In this example, we use the term "proportional" to describe the models that we use to describe the spread of the infection. In our example, the model uses the term "proportion" to describe the population with a low level of immunization and the term "immunization" to describe the population whose immunization level is high. The idea of "proportional" is that the number of infected households and workplaces is proportional to the number of households where the immunization level is high and the number of workplaces where the immunization level isn't high. We show that the concept of "proportional spread" is useful in modeling the spread of an infection in a population.

Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>T cell activation is predicated on the interaction between the T cell receptor and peptide-major histocompatibility (pMHC) ligands. The factors that determine the stimulatory potency of a pMHC molecule remain unclear. We describe results showing that a peptide exhibiting many hallmarks of a weak agonist stimulates T cells to proliferate more than the wild-type agonist ligand. An in silico approach suggested that the inability to form the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) could underlie the increased proliferation. This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed that enhancing cSMAC formation reduced stimulatory capacity of the weak peptide. Our studies highlight the fact that a complex interplay of factors determines the quality of a T cell antigen.<n><n>### Response:<n>		T cell activation depends on the interaction between the receptor and the peptide-major histological composition. We describe results showing a weak agonist stimulates the T cells to proliferate.

The extracted Malay ambiguous words (potential) are then being mapped onto the constructed ambiguity attributes to confirm their vagueness. The list is then verified by Malay linguist experts. This paper aims to identify a list of potential ambiguous words in Malay as an attempt to assist writers to avoid using the vague words while documenting Malay Requirement Specification as well as to any other related Malay documentation. The result of this study is a list of 120 potential ambiguous Malay words that could act as guidelines in writing Malay sentences.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Malay words are commonly used in Malay documents such as Requirement Specifying.

The fundamental reason is the difficulty of backpropagation through discrete random variables combined with the inherent instability of the GAN training objective. To address these problems, we propose Maximum-Likelihood Augmented Discrete Generative Adversarial Networks. Instead of directly optimizing the GAN objective, we derive a novel and low-variance objective using the discriminator’s output that follows corresponds to the log-likelihood. Compared with the original, the new objective is proved to be consistent in theory and beneficial in practice. The experimental results on various discrete datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The new maximum likelihood objective is consistent in theory and beneficial to the performance of the GAN training algorithm.

However, much is unknown about mechanisms which can give rise to coherent oscillatory behavior, with few exceptions (e.g., explicitly delayed self-repressors and simple models of specific organisms' circadian clocks). We present what may be the simplest possible reliable gene network oscillator, a self-repressing gene.

We present a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning (i.e. state estimation and system identification) in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. We place a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, resulting in a flexible model able to capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efficient inference, we marginalize over the transition dynamics function and infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using specially tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution can be formulated analytically. Our approach preserves the full nonparametric expressivity of the model and can make use of sparse Gaussian processes to greatly reduce computational complexity.<n><n>### Response:<n>		State-space modeling is used in many areas of Science, Engineering and Economics.

The birth-weights of babies born to women with inflammatory bowel disease were marginally lower than those born to women in a control group matched for age and parity, but the difference was statistically significant only in women with Crohn's disease. In both disease groups there was a higher frequency of low haemoglobin levels in pregnancy than in the matched control groups. There were no statistically significant effects of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease on duration of pregnancy, mode of delivery or raised blood pressure and/or proteinuria. In the absence of a relapse, a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease should not influence obstetric management.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease had a major effect in pregnancy, but the difference was not statistically significant in either disease group.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Colorization of grayscale images has been a hot topic in computer vision. Previous research mainly focuses on producing a colored image to match the original one. However, since many colors share the same gray value, an input grayscale image could be diversely colored while maintaining its reality. In this paper, we design a novel solution for unsupervised diverse colorization. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative adversarial networks to model the distribution of real-world item colors, in which we develop a fully convolutional generator with multi-layer noise to enhance diversity, with multi-layer condition concatenation to maintain reality, and with stride 1 to keep spatial information. With such a novel network architecture, the model yields highly competitive performance on the open LSUN bedroom dataset. The Turing test of 80 humans further indicates our generated color schemes are highly convincible.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The Turing test of 80 humans confirms our generated color schemes are strongly believable.

However, designing studies around the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology POR criteria can be methodologically challenging, as the new definition includes various POR subpopulations with diverse baseline characteristics and unknown clinical prognosis. When designing RCTs, potential result bias may be introduced if women from each subpopulation are not evenly allocated between intervention groups. In the case of small or moderate-size RCTs, a single-sequence randomization method may not ensure balanced allocation between groups. Stratified randomization methods provide an alternative methodological approach. Depending on the chosen methodology, patient characteristics and outcomes within each intervention group may be better reported according to relevant subpopulations.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Title:<n>Bologna criteria for defining POR during IVF provide a convenient template for new research in the field of assisted conception.<n><n>However, designing studies around the Europe Society for Human Reproduction & Embryology POR guidelines can be methodologically challenging.<n><n>When designing RCTs, prospective study participants may be assigned to either an intervention group or a control group based on the outcome of the intervention.

We develop a robustness metric derived from source-aware lower and upper bounds of model accuracy even when data source labels are not readily available. We clearly demonstrate that even on a well-explored dataset like MNIST, challenging training scenarios can be constructed under the proposed assessment framework for two separate yet equally important applications: i) more rigorous learning model comparison and ii) dataset adequacy evaluation. In addition, our findings not only promise a more complete identification of trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy and robustness but can also help researchers optimize their efforts in data collection by identifying the less robust and more challenging class labels.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We develop a robustness metric based on source-aware lower and upward bounds of model accuracy.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.<n><n>### Input:<n>Abstract: Five children, aged 6 to 16 years, were tested for unilateral discrimination and interhemispheric transfer of tactile information as well as tactuomotor learning at various intervals before and after therapeutic callosotomy. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children. Bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms. The most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways. The relatively greater deficits observed in the older children, on the other hand, suggest that sensorimotor functions come to depend more extensively on contralateral pathways as the corpus callosum reaches functional maturity.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The five children tested were aged 6 to 16 years. The authors tested the children for unilateral discrimination and intermusispheric transfer of tactile and motor information. The results showed that younger children are considerably more affected by the interruption of the callosal transmission than older kids.

The direct effect on stimulated SA production of pre-incubating cells with prednisolone in vitro was also studied. Significant inhibition of monocyte SA output stimulated with IgG-treated zymosan (ITZ) and fluoride ion (F), but not serum-treated zymosan (STZ) was demonstrated following steroid therapy in RA. No inhibitory effect of prednisolone could be demonstrated in vitro, using ITZ, STZ and F as stimuli. Our data on blood monocyte yields, size and cytochemistry suggest that the in vivo effect is due to a shift in blood monocyte traffic.<n><n>### Response:<n>		RA patients, who received corticosteroids for RA, were able to generate significantly more plasma superoxide (SA) than the control group. This was confirmed by the direct effect of prednisolones on stimulated plasma levels of SA.

The UAS of the parser is on par with that of a greedy discriminative baseline. As a language model, it obtains better perplexity than a n-gram model by performing semi-supervised learning over a large unlabelled corpus. We show that the model is able to generate locally and syntactically coherent sentences, opening the door to further applications in language generation.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We propose a model that can generate locally and syntactally coherent sentences, opening the doors to further applications in language creation.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Decentralized POMDPs provide an expressive framework for multi-agent sequential decision making. While finite-horizon DECPOMDPs have enjoyed significant success, progress remains slow for the infinite-horizon case mainly due to the inherent complexity of optimizing stochastic controllers representing agent policies. We present a promising new class of algorithms for the infinite-horizon case, which recasts the optimization problem as inference in a mixture of DBNs. An attractive feature of this approach is the straightforward adoption of existing inference techniques in DBNs for solving DEC-POMDPs and supporting richer representations such as factored or continuous states and actions. We also derive the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize the joint policy represented as DBNs. Experiments on benchmark domains show that EM compares favorably against the state-of-the-art solvers.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In this task you are given a part<n>of an article.

Using current data from seven sources new reference curves have been estimated from birth to 20 years for children in 1990. The great majority of the data are nationally representative. The analysis used Cole's LMS method and has produced efficient estimates of the conventional centiles and gives a good fit to the data. These curves differ from the currently used curves at key ages for both stature and weight. In view of the concerns expressed about the current curves and the differences between them and the new curves, it is proposed that the curves presented here should be adopted as the new UK reference curves.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The current reference curve of stature and weight for children in the UK was first published in 1966.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We develop a new model for Interactive Question Answering (IQA), using GatedRecurrent-Unit recurrent networks (GRUs) as encoders for statements and questions, and another GRU as a decoder for outputs. Distinct from previous work, our approach employs context-dependent word-level attention for more accurate statement representations and question-guided sentence-level attention for better context modeling. Employing these mechanisms, our model accurately understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a supplementary question for additional input. When available, user’s feedback is encoded and directly applied to update sentence-level attention to infer the answer. Extensive experiments on QA and IQA datasets demonstrate quantitatively the effectiveness of our model with significant improvement over conventional QA models.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here is the text generated by the task:<n><n>Inventing the Future: How AI Will Change the World, by Neil Gaiman, is a novel written in the first person and based on the science of artificial intelligence.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>The AGM theory of belief revision has be­ come an important paradigm for investigat­ ing rational belief changes. Unfortunately, researchers working in this paradigm have re­ stricted much of their attention to rather sim­ ple representations of belief states, namely logically closed sets of propositional sen­ tences. In our opinion, this has resulted in a too abstract categorisation of belief change operations: expansion, revision, or contrac­ tion. Occasionally, in the AGM paradigm, also probabilistic belief changes have been considered, and it is widely accepted that the probabilistic version of expansion is con­ ditioning. However, we argue that it may be more correct to view conditioning and expan­ sion as two essentially different kinds of belief change, and that what we call constraining is a better candidate for being considered prob­ abilistic expansion.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The AGM theories of belief re­vision and contrac­tion posi­tion have been described by several researchers as being too abstract and unable to generalise to other belief states. For example, in the MCM theory of belief revision, the attribution of belief states to a substance is only able to be reached with sufficiently high probabilistic accuracy, and the sort of reasoning that is possible with probabilistic beliefs is mainly dependent on the state of the agent at the time of the survey. In contrast, the authors of the AGM theory of belief retraction have described it as being able to generalise to other beliefs, and it is widely acknowledged that the probabilistic model is more accurate for more basic beliefs.

Where the urethral sphincter was competent, patients with urge incontinence with or without detrusor instability during filling cystometry had a good response to drugs, providing a sustained detrusor contraction was present during voiding. Urethral sphincter incompetence was characterised by a low detrusor voiding pressure.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The abstract of this paper discusses the nature of the pressure-volume plot and how it can be used to predict the outcome of treatment.

This problem may be even worse for postgraduate students who are new to a field and may not know where to start. To address this problem, we have developed an online catalog of research papers where the papers have been automatically categorized by a topic model. The catalog contains 7719 papers from the proceedings of two artificial intelligence conferences from 2000 to 2015. Rather than the commonly used Latent Dirichlet Allocation, we use a recently proposed method called hierarchical latent tree analysis for topic modeling. The resulting topic model contains a hierarchy of topics so that users can browse the topics from the top level to the bottom level. The topic model contains a manageable number of general topics at the top level and allows thousands of fine-grained topics at the bottom level. It also can detect topics that have emerged recently.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The topic model of this task is hierarchical latent tree analysis (HLT).  The topic model is composed of several general topics at the top and bottom levels and can detect topics that have surfaced recently.

We have assessed HPRT mutants in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with connective tissue diseases who have been treated for long periods with cytotoxic drugs. The results from patients treated with cyclophosphamide were abnormal suggesting the presence of drug-induced mutations. The results from patients treated with chlorambucil or azathioprine did not differ from controls--either these drugs have not induced mutations or, more likely, the technique is not sufficiently sensitive to detect them. These possibilities are discussed. Specific mutations induced by cytotoxic drugs in patients with connective tissue diseases have not been previously recorded.<n><n>### Response:<n>		This paper describes the detection of hypoxanthine-Guanine phosphoribOS-HPRT mutations in peripheral blood lymphocytes, which are typically used to detect drug-induced mutations in human blood cells.

Cas9 can also be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with minimal mutagenic activity. Lastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided nuclease technology.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Functional elucidation of causal genetic variants and element requires precise genome editing technologies

However, so far no drug against HIV-1 infection exhibiting this mechanism of action has been approved. To identify new potent candidates for inhibitors, we performed in silico screening of a commercial database of more than 1,300 drug-like compounds by using receptorbased docking studies. The candidates selected from docking studies were subsequently tested using biological assays to assess anti-HIV activities. As a result, two compounds were identified as the most active. Specifically, both exhibited anti-HIV activity against viral replication at a low concentration and relatively low cytotoxicity at the effective concentration inhibiting viral growth by 50 %.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Cyclophilic Anaphylaxis (Cyclophilin) A, a new target of HIV-1 immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2, has attracted attention as a novel target of anti-human immuneodeficiency virus types1 and 2. However, so far there is no drug against HIV-2 infection exhibiting this mechanism of activity. To identify new potent compounds for inhibitors, we conducted in silico screening of the commercial database of more than 300 drug-like compounds by employing receptorbased docking studies. We found that two compounds were the most active. Specifically, both exhibited anti-HII activity against viral replication at low concentration and relatively low cytotoxicity at the effective concentrations inhibiting viral growth by 25 %.

In reality, before a new order can be put into production, a series of activities known as pre-production events need to be completed. In addition, in real production process, owing to various uncertainties, the daily production quantity of each order is not always as expected. In this research, by considering the pre-production events and the uncertainties in the daily production quantity, robust order scheduling problems in the fashion industry are investigated with the aid of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) called nondominated sorting adaptive differential evolution (NSJADE). The experimental results illustrate that it is of paramount importance to consider pre-production events in order scheduling problems in the fashion industry. We also unveil that the existence of the uncertainties in the daily production quantity heavily affects the order scheduling.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The existence of the uncertainties in daily production quantity heavily affects order scheduling problems in the clothing industry.

We were unable to show any abnormality in the excretion of Zn, Mg or GAG. In 11 patients, a low level of urinary citrate was a significant feature that was associated in most cases with a urinary pH value above 6. Citrate concentration (per litre) and output (per 24 h) were found to be lower than in the controls in 19 and 33% respectively of the determinations. The overall ratio of average urinary citrate concentration in patients and controls was 0.56, a figure in agreement with previous data.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The excretion of four inhibitors in the presence of calcium stone formers was studied in 20 healthy adults. We were unable to find any abnormal excretion of Zn or Mg in these individuals. In 11 patients, urinary citrate was a feature that was associated in almost every instance with a urinary pH value below 6. The ratio of average urinary citric acid concentration in patients and controls were 0.56.
