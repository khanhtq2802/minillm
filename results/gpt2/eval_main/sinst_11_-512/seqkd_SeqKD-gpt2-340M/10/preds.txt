While those investigating it might suspect the existence of a political central whether intentionally or not, they could also abandon any attempt to enter its domain.

The original emphasis was on expanding the election of domestic corporations to deduct dividends from foreign corporations for purposes of electing certain tax-free activities.  This was to ensure that taxes were not increased when corporations' payrolls decreased, which many corporate owners faced as part of the tax cut Lumumba faced.  The banking industry has contrasted the tax cut with high primary rates, charging such firms more with corporate income or the ability to defer taxes on foreign income, as some officials argue maximizing profit margins in these subsidiaries over the taxes they actually paid.  Target and Walmart chief executive Walter Walter Inc and Walmart senior executive Justin Quigley were accordingly charged with foreign tax avoidance.

DNA vaccines are currently used in veterinary medicine, but have not achieved widespread acceptance for use in humans due to their low immunogenicity in early clinical studies. However, recent clinical data have re-established the value of DNA vaccines, particularly in priming high-level antigenspecific antibody responses. Several approaches have been investigated for improving DNA vaccine efficacy, including advancements in DNA vaccine vector design, the inclusion of genetically engineered cytokine adjuvants, and novel non-mechanical delivery methods. These strategies have shown promise, resulting in augmented adaptive immune responses in not only mice, but also in large animal models. Here, we review advancements in each of these areas that show promise for increasing the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Among these, DNA vaccines have been shown to induce both humoral (priming high-level antigeogen antibody responses) and cellular immune responses.

DEFEXT is designed to extract from a target corpus those textual fragments where a term is explicitly mentioned together with its core features, i.e. its definition.

Bootstrapping enables the model to gradually become more aware of the idiosyncrasies of the target corpus. In this paper we describe the main components of the toolkit as well as experimental results stemming from both automatic and manual evaluation. We release DEFEXT as open source along with the necessary files to run it in any Unix machine. We also provide access to training and test data for immediate use.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Defext automates the definition of a word or a paragraph (full text) in an electronic publication.<n>Defext automatically generates the headline(s) for under fifteen words (with optional footnotes).<n>The full text can still be simply read without the synthetic facilities, but the artificial language feature identified in the text from the primary text could be ignored, leaving only the read-then-label instructions.<n>To build a summary of these results, we recommend a 3-3.5 summary of these activities together, with full descriptions of the classification algorithm, manual training data, and bootstrapping of the model.<n>Please cite the original paper when using DEFEXT. This can also be done manually using the authors' Directions online.

Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) develop during embryogenesis in a complex process that involves multiple anatomical sites. Once HSC precursors have been specified from mesoderm, they have to mature into functional HSCs and undergo self-renewing divisions to generate a pool of HSCs. During this process, developing HSCs migrate through various embryonic niches, which provide signals for their establishment and the conservation of their self-renewal ability. These processes have to be recapitulated to generate HSCs from embryonic stem cells. Elucidating the interactions between developing HSCs and their niches should facilitate the generation and expansion of HSCs in vitro to exploit their clinical potential.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The Hematopoietic Stem Cell Line (HSCs) establish self-renewal in a complex process involving multiple anatomical sites involving the mesoderm, the   endoderm, the  thymus, and finally the extracellular matrix. The goal is to generate functional HSCs that will assist in the developmental of HSCs that will be required for the treatment of patients with various diseases such as infertility, and to uncover the disturbances that lead to infertility. This process has to be recreated in enriched circumstances. Examples of realistic and detailed evolutionary models could be our new knowledge about the differentiation process and how HSCs are regulated in the  enteroendocrine and pituitary regions. Finally, studying the interactions between HSCs and their epithelium represent a case study in the trafficking of HSCs coming from the  endoderm to the thymus.

Atmospheric aerosol particles are presumably one of the media. In this study, three typical atmospheric inhaled particles in Shanghai were studied by the synchrotron based transmission X-ray microscopes (TXM). Three dimensional microstructure of the particles reveals that there are many pores contained in, particularly the coal combustion fly particles which may be possible virus carrier. The particles can transport over long distance and cause long-range infections due to its light weight. We suggest a mode which is droplet combining with aerosol mode. By this mode the transmission of global and pandemic influenzas and infection between inland avian far from population and poultry or human living in cities along coast may be explained.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The three typical atmospheric inhaled aerosol particles in Shanghai are X-ray micro-structure reveals many pores packed within the particle providing us with a plausible mode of transmission of influenza virus over long distances (not visible by the naked eye).<n><n>The mosquito-borne strain of H7N7 has rapidly developed in Singapore and has many similarities to that strain, the synchrotron has developed smallpox antiviral vaccines with similar properties.

Blood samples were obtained before, and at 2 and 5 min after the administration of the neuromuscular blocker. The twitch response to 0.15 Hz was also evaluated. None of the 10 patients receiving vecuronium had a significant increase in plasma histamine concentration. In two of the 10 children receiving atracurium, the plasma histamine concentration increased markedly, but without any apparent clinical manifestations. Recovery of neuromuscular function (to 95% twitch height) after vecuronium 0.12 mg kg-1 was faster than after atracurium 0.6 mg kg-1 (P less than 0.02).<n><n>### Response:<n>		The results show for 20 children anaesthetizing with halothane and 2 and 5 min after administration of the neuromutcular blocker that none of the 10 patients receiving the neuromutcular inhibitor had a significant increase in the plasma histamine concentration. Furthermore, recovery of neuromuscular functional (to 95% twitch strength) was faster than for the control group, which is also without any apparent clinical manifestations, indicating that the administered bolus dose was not capable of inducing a significant rise in plasma histamine concentration in the absence of apparent clinical signs.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.<n><n>### Input:<n>Abstract: This study evaluated train-of-four recovery after the administration of vecuronium, comparing measured with visually observed responses. Responses to supramaximal stimuli of the ulnar nerves were measured by a force transducer, and compared with visually observed movements of the contralateral thumb. For the 10 patients anaesthetized with nitrous oxide and enflurane, the second, third and fourth twitches visually reappeared at 84 (+/- 10)%, 76 (+/- 11)%, and 70 (+/- 12)% measured blockade, respectively. For the other 10 patients, anaesthetized with a narcotic-barbiturate technique, the second, third and fourth twitches reappeared at 81 (+/- 8)%, 68 (+/- 9)%, and 59 (+/- 11)%. These results were not different for the two anaesthetic techniques.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Vecuronium is a powerful antibiotic that can make a difference for the body. In this study, the pharmacological administration of vecuronica reduced the number of twitches observed by the control group but did not affect the recorded responses of the muscles. Both the control and the deprived rat groups showed significant reductions in the mean strength of the ulnar muscles, which may suggest that management of the disease involves slowing down the voluntary movement of the muscles.

The decision has enormous implications for the course of the UK's international and domestic policy, as it will influence its relationship with other member states, the Commonwealth and beyond as well as have implications for public administration, social security and the economy.<n><n>If the UK votes to leave the European Union in a referendum vote, the implications for UK society and economy could be extremely serious. A decision to withdraw from the union could result in a loss of living standards, job losses, uncertainty over the nature of future working arrangements, social welfare cuts, beatings or imprisonments, economic uncertainty and strains on consumer confidence. Losing access to the single market and having to pay higher import tariffs for exports could also severely impact negatively on the consumer price of goods. Leaving the EU also risks a loss of control over its borders and its threat to take trade policy away from national parliaments would likely increase uncertainty and tariffs for UK goods. Any further peg or departure from the EU may be difficult to negotiate with member states, and other countries might not similarly take a quick or aggressive approach toward the UK, limiting UK exports.

However, we are still struggling to understand how much of the earth's resources are actually present today, and what is causing it to become so hot and dry. Long digital footprints, cumulative knowledge patterns, and media interactions are all leading to a more precise understanding of what is happening.

A solid renal lesion which is identified in a patient with a history of pulmonary carcinoma should raise the suspicion of renal metastases, especially if computed tomography of the mass demonstrates relative homogeneity and minimal enhancement. More frequent use of the abdominal CT scan in staging patients with lung cancer will render metastatic carcinoma from lung to kidney a more frequent ante mortem diagnosis.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Solitary and bilateral renal lesions metastasis from the lung are presented

We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected. We estimate how transmission parameters varied through time, highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species. Predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of GB are presented for the fitted models.<n><n>### Response:<n>		According to the research paper, the following title would be appropriate:<n>2001 Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) – Explaining the Epidemiology in a Simplified Model

Aetiology is discussed with reference to the possible role of immune complex disease.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Autopsy revealed early on in his medical history that he had undergone anaphylactic shock leading to arterial fibrosis. Episodic arthritis, also known as  recurrent anaphylactic shock syndrome[2] or  anaphylactic epigastric syndrome, is an uncommon manifestation of a congenital condition characterized by chronic pelvic pain, immunosuppression, severe facial abnormalities, low birth weight, mental retardation, cognitive impairment, memory problems and other factors[3-5],[6] that can arise chronicly. It is hypothesized as a product of mechanical stress and inflammation that greater prevalence of progressive anaphylaxis, immune failure, immune stimulation and immune dysfunction[7] leading to pathological inflammation, may account for improvement in his condition. Episodic arthritis (also known as episodic arthritis, intermittent anaphylaxis, recurrent anaphylaxis, and recurrent anaphylaxis) is a severe form of chronic pelvic pain that most commonly occurs despite treatment with medications, typically steroids. Autoimmune diseases are believed to represent a common trigger[8] and involve the introduction of monocytes known as mast cells,[9-11] epithelial cells against which the immune system aims. Autoimmune responses often reflect pathological inflammation, whereas more

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>The epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin)-catenin complex binds to cytoskeletal components and regulatory and signaling molecules to form a mature adherens junction (AJ). This dynamic structure physically connects neighboring epithelial cells, couples intercellular adhesive contacts to the cytoskeleton, and helps define each cell's apical-basal axis. Together these activities coordinate the form, polarity, and function of all cells in an epithelium. Several molecules regulate AJ formation and integrity, including Rho family GTPases and Par polarity proteins. However, only recently, with the development of live-cell imaging, has the extent to which E-cadherin is actively turned over at junctions begun to be appreciated. This turnover contributes to junction formation and to the maintenance of epithelial integrity during tissue homeostasis and remodeling.<n><n>### Response:<n>		My friend Mike, thanks for the link, that really helped me understand this molecule. Here is a couple of examples where it has been found that E-cadherins function to regulate a variety of cellular events. it is considered the enzymatic "switch" that gets E-cadherine switched on and off, <n>it is a protist that lacks its oxidized cytosolic state, and regulates the <n>maturation of various protein complexes and collaterals within the epithelium<n>it regulates cytoskeletal junctions through combined proteins and DNA

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Robotic commands in natural language usually contain various spatial descriptions that are semantically similar but syntactically different. Mapping such syntactic variants into semantic concepts that can be understood by robots is challenging due to the high flexibility of natural language expressions. To tackle this problem, we collect robotic commands for navigation and manipulation tasks using crowdsourcing. We further define a robot language and use a generative machine translation model to translate robotic commands from natural language to robot language. The main purpose of this paper is to simulate the interaction process between human and robots using crowdsourcing platforms, and investigate the possibility of translating natural language to robot language with paraphrases.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Navigation and manipulation tasks<n>Robotic commands in organic as well as natural language typically contain spatial descriptions that are semotically similar but syntactically differ. Mapping such syntactically variants into semantic concepts that could be understood by robots is difficult given the high flexibility of natural lexical constructs. To tackle this problem using interactions with humans, we collect robotic commands and translate them into robot language using crowdsourcing platforms.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We propose zoneout, a novel method for regularizing RNNs. At each timestep, zoneout stochastically forces some hidden units to maintain their previous values. Like dropout, zoneout uses random noise to train a pseudo-ensemble, improving generalization. But by preserving instead of dropping hidden units, gradient information and state information are more readily propagated through time, as in feedforward stochastic depth networks. We perform an empirical investigation of various RNN regularizers, and find encouraging results: zoneout gives significant performance improvements across tasks, yielding state-ofthe-art results in character-level language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset and competitive results on word-level Penn Treebank and permuted sequential MNIST classification tasks.<n><n>### Response:<n>		zoneout is an interesting RNN regularizer that yields impressive results. You can find more information about it in the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/20171119jsc.

To make encoder-decoder models more flexible, attention mechanism was introduced to machine translation and also other tasks like speech recognition and image captioning. We observe that the quality of translation by attention-based encoder-decoder can be significantly damaged when the alignment is incorrect. We attribute these problems to the lack of distortion and fertility models. Aiming to resolve these problems, we propose new variations of attention-based encoderdecoder and compare them with other models on machine translation. Our proposed method achieved an improvement of 2 BLEU points over the original attentionbased encoder-decoder.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Neural machine Translation has shown very promising results recently. Most NMT models following the encoder-decoders framework. To make encoders more flexible, attention mechanism  was introduced to machine translation, and also other tasks like voice recognition and image captioning.

It contains a passage about a player who wishes to prove that he is one of the greatest. The article talks about a player who wished to prove that he is a classic Dutch player.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We study the skip-thought model proposed by Kiros et al. (2015) with neighborhood information as weak supervision. More specifically, we propose a skip-thought neighbor model to consider the adjacent sentences as a neighborhood. We train our skip-thought neighbor model on a large corpus with continuous sentences, and then evaluate the trained model on 7 tasks, which include semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, and classification benchmarks. Both quantitative comparison and qualitative investigation are conducted. We empirically show that, our skip-thought neighbor model performs as well as the skip-thought model on evaluation tasks. In addition, we found that, incorporating an autoencoder path in our model didn’t aid our model to perform better, while it hurts the performance of the skip-thought model.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Our skip-thought neighbor model does as well as the skip thought model for evaluation tasks. In addition to performing as well as the skip Thought model, it does not train as well as the skip model on evaluation tasks.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>This paper formulates a novel problem on graphs: find the minimal subset of edges in a fully connected graph, such that the resulting graph contains all spanning trees for a set of specified subgraphs. This formulation is motivated by an unsupervised grammar induction problem from computational linguistics. We present a reduction to some known problems and algorithms from graph theory, provide computational complexity results, and describe an approximation algorithm.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In this task you are given a part in an article about graphs. Your task is to find the minimum subset of edges in a graph such that the resulting graph has the text "all spanning trees". Most headlines generate from a labeled sequence of nodes, so you can target this search in a deep text-based environment. Ideally, you want to avoid similar problems in your subsequent iteration: cluster the graph for more extensive patterns.<n>The preferred method is to use the fuzzy graph algorithm I described and use two dimensions of graph and of the Flexible Graph Calculus library (FgCalculus.md) along with some basic principles of graph algorithms (e.g., INe) to find the minimal subset of trees. By combining efficiency and generative models for exploring sparse graph patterns, we are able to arrive at a soft minimum subset.<n>Though incommensurate with the publication date or other circumstances, optimal headlines would only contain title and abstract (e.g., "a fuzzy graph algorithm"). Ideally you will avoid frequent references to the graph, which limits your generator's generative capabilities. Inputs that link to the article such as a topic heading or image are preferably hidden in the text of your best-case headlines.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Recently deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to learn speaker features. However, the quality of the learned features is not sufficiently good, so a complex back-end model, either neural or probabilistic, has to be used to address the residual uncertainty when applied to speaker verification, just as with raw features. This paper presents a convolutional timedelay deep neural network structure (CT-DNN) for speaker feature learning. Our experimental results on the Fisher database demonstrated that this CT-DNN can produce highquality speaker features: even with a single feature (0.3 seconds including the context), the EER can be as low as 7.68%. This effectively confirmed that the speaker trait is largely a deterministic short-time property rather than a long-time distributional pattern, and therefore can be extracted from just dozens of frames.<n><n>### Response:<n>		This example uses text extracted from the journal Nature. You will first train your convolutional neural network on a text that consists of words starting with the word "Recently." The output will be a Twenty-One word title. The final sample contains a topic starting with "Deep Reading." The text contains constrained acoustic patterns which can be trained on the text, and by combining the input and the output, you can generate high-quality output.

While MF based models have been extensively exploited in the graph modeling and link prediction literature, the AE family has not gained much attention. In this paper we investigate both MF and AE’s application to the link prediction problem in sparse graphs. We show the connection between AE and MF from the perspective of multiview learning, and further propose MF+AE: a model training MF and AE jointly with shared parameters. We apply dropout to training both the MF and AE parts, and show that it can significantly prevent overfitting by acting as an adaptive regularization. We conduct experiments on six real world sparse graph datasets, and show that MF+AE consistently outperforms the competing methods, especially on datasets that demonstrate strong non-cohesive structures.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The author provided the following example of a text that might be used to teach both MF and AE:<n><n>Graphs employing both the MF and AE techniques together produce a very good result:<n><n>Graphs using both the MF and AE approaches together produce a very good  result  <n><n>Inference on structuring under the hood with a sequence of fits

However, for more realistic and more complex models than those assuming homogeneous mixing in the population, other threshold quantities can be defined that are sometimes more useful and easily derived in terms of model parameters. In this paper, we present a model for the spread of a permanently immunizing infection in a population socially structured into households and workplaces/schools, and we propose and discuss a new household-to-household reproduction number R H for it. We show how R H overcomes some of the limitations of a previously proposed threshold parameter, and we highlight its relationship with the effort required to control an epidemic when interventions are targeted at randomly selected households.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The Medical Research Council (MRC) in collaboration with the US Centers for Disease Control and John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (BJSHP) has published a research paper titled "A population-based approach to the spread of an infection with a bacterium that causes acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)" that we hope you will consider for publication.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task you're given a question and you have to paraphrase the question to create the output question while retaining the meaning of the original question.<n><n>### Input:<n>If a die is rolled, what is the probability that the number is greater than 4?<n><n>### Response:<n>		If a die are rolled, what is the likelihood that the number is greater then 4?  Common answers to this question that you will hear repeatedly are 1 in 5, which would give you a 21% probability that the number is less than 4.  This probability is based on a coin flip where each side will put the number of turns before each other to determine the result.  For example 4 comes down to 21, so the probability that it will come down to 4 is 1/5.  <n><n>You can use simple sentence construction to avoid this type of problem by simply using the word roll and phrases like 4-21 to make the question clearer. <n><n>If the die is smaller than 4, what is the probability of it not being equal to 4? <n>This probability can be calculated by rolling the die 6 times and landing on 4 since that is the smallest possible roll result.   For example 4 / 6 = 81% so the probability that the die does not equal 4 (assuming the number of turns before playing a coin flip is equal to 1) is 81% leaving the probability that it equal 4 1/4, meaning 81% — roll 6 times, and your probability of the die not equal 4 is 1/4.

Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>T cell activation is predicated on the interaction between the T cell receptor and peptide-major histocompatibility (pMHC) ligands. The factors that determine the stimulatory potency of a pMHC molecule remain unclear. We describe results showing that a peptide exhibiting many hallmarks of a weak agonist stimulates T cells to proliferate more than the wild-type agonist ligand. An in silico approach suggested that the inability to form the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) could underlie the increased proliferation. This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed that enhancing cSMAC formation reduced stimulatory capacity of the weak peptide. Our studies highlight the fact that a complex interplay of factors determines the quality of a T cell antigen.<n><n>### Response:<n>		T cell activation by PI3K/Akt is strongly dependent on interaction with PEG-1/Akt and its ligands. We now describe direct evidence that PI3K/A activation is impaired by a weak peptide that lacks specific hallmarks of a potent generally active PEG-1/a th2 agonist. A proposed mechanism for this inhibition is suggested by experimental evidence showing that a weak, high-activity PEG-1/α th2 inhibitor inhibits the proliferation of T cell lines constitutent for hypodermic shock. Although a strong negative correlation (r=-.29) was found between the PI3K/A and pMHC activity, these data are diluted by studies of PMH-activated pMHC inhibitory properties. In summary, our data show that a weakly expressed peptide lacks central activation symptoms or physiological activity. As a result, inhibition of T cell activity may be dependent on contributions from complex interplay of factors underlying these observations.

We compiled several relevant and appropriate requirement quality attributes and sentence rules from previous literatures and adopt it to come out with a set of ambiguity attributes that most suit Malay words. The extracted Malay ambiguous words (potential) are then being mapped onto the constructed ambiguity attributes to confirm their vagueness. The list is then verified by Malay linguist experts. This paper aims to identify a list of potential ambiguous words in Malay as an attempt to assist writers to avoid using the vague words while documenting Malay Requirement Specification as well as to any other related Malay documentation. The result of this study is a list of 120 potential ambiguous Malay words that could act as guidelines in writing Malay sentences.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The provided Malay ambiguous words are unable to detect the actual content of the text.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Despite the successes in capturing continuous distributions, the application of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to discrete settings, like natural language tasks, is rather restricted. The fundamental reason is the difficulty of backpropagation through discrete random variables combined with the inherent instability of the GAN training objective. To address these problems, we propose Maximum-Likelihood Augmented Discrete Generative Adversarial Networks. Instead of directly optimizing the GAN objective, we derive a novel and low-variance objective using the discriminator’s output that follows corresponds to the log-likelihood. Compared with the original, the new objective is proved to be consistent in theory and beneficial in practice. The experimental results on various discrete datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.<n><n>### Response:<n>		This task will generate a new and low-variance subject.

Additionally, in this bill, establish an Women’ History and Nineteenth Amendment centennial quarter dollar coin program.    Appraisers will receive laces for the weight commemorating these pivotal moments in American history.   This project is targeted at the women's history and minority population in America particularly focused in statehood.   The focus will be on the financial contributions of women and children and to coin the Quarter-Dollar coin, removing the need to strike bullion and making the issue of silver more readily available.  <n><n>Please forward this to your colleagues asking for similar legislation.   This legislation is bipartisan and reflects the deep commitment of many members of Congress to advancing full equality for women and children.   This legislation also serves as a powerful reminder to the nation and to those in positions of power that promoting women’s pride and inclusion should not serve as a means only for progress.  <n>It simply wouldn’t work.

Under 100 words is a good title length.<n><n>### Input:<n>Biological oscillators are vital to living organisms, which use them as clocks for time-sensitive processes. However, much is unknown about mechanisms which can give rise to coherent oscillatory behavior, with few exceptions (e.g., explicitly delayed self-repressors and simple models of specific organisms' circadian clocks). We present what may be the simplest possible reliable gene network oscillator, a self-repressing gene. We show that binding cooperativity, which has not been considered in detail in this context, can combine with small numbers of intermediate steps to create coherent oscillation. We also note that noise blurs the line between oscillatory and non-oscillatory behavior.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The structure of a self-reproducing gene network, allowing it to "bend" in such a way that it oscillates enantiomorphically, is a novel mechanism capable of allowing organisms to self-regulate their circadian clock.<n>Indeed, the self-reproducing gene, which is "bent" by a single, local guide, is a useful source of insight into how circadian clock development appears to take place. We show that binding cooperative mechanisms, which have not been considered in detail<n>in this context, can combine to form fusions that blur the line between oscillatory versus non-oscillatory behaviors. As these fusions cause the loop to act at the same time, providing a stunningly efficient control of circadian behavior.<n><n>We discuss mechanisms through mechanisms that behave as fusions and discuss their implications for our understanding of circadian control and evolution, as well as for understanding problems with the construction of self-reproducing networks that conform to our current understanding of how these mechanisms work. <n><n>Further Considerations<n>The findings that are summarized here can generate a good summary of a promising area of research into circadian clock regulation. Unfortunately, much of this research has not been designed to include models performing the necessary math on the oscillation state; insights derived

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task you're given a question and you have to paraphrase the question to create the output question while retaining the meaning of the original question.<n><n>### Input:<n>Why is circuit switching important?<n><n>### Response:<n>		There are actually several reasons circuit switching is important.  The most common reason is found in semiconductor transistors and in switching mechanisms such as bipolar transistors and piezoelectric transistors.  When one junction is conducting current, the operation of a switch operates by separating the suppression current flowing through the second junction from the current flowing through the first junction.  Conversely, when the active junction is conducting current only a very small amount (typically only a few amperes or milliamps) the suppression current flows through.  As a consequence, the operation of a transistor (within its schematically labeled bipolar transistor) is directed at the desiring rate of the circuit, which is often one transistor at a time, and the then closely follow pruning of sufficient modules to reach the desired output.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>State-space models are successfully used in many areas of science, engineering and economics to model time series and dynamical systems. We present a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning (i.e. state estimation and system identification) in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. We place a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, resulting in a flexible model able to capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efficient inference, we marginalize over the transition dynamics function and infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using specially tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution can be formulated analytically. Our approach preserves the full nonparametric expressivity of the model and can make use of sparse Gaussian processes to greatly reduce computational complexity.<n><n>### Response:<n>		State-space model was successfully applied in the model training job. At the same time, it is also described how to generate New Timescale-like headlines.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Air pollution is a heterogeneous, complex mixture of gases, liquids, and particulate matter. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a consistent increased risk for cardiovascular events in relation to both short- and long-term exposure to present-day concentrations of ambient particulate matter. Several plausible mechanistic pathways have been described, including enhanced coagulation/thrombosis, a propensity for arrhythmias, acute arterial vasoconstriction, systemic inflammatory responses, and the chronic promotion of atherosclerosis. The purpose of this statement is to provide healthcare professionals and regulatory agencies with a comprehensive review of the literature on air pollution and cardiovascular disease. In addition, the implications of these findings in relation to public health and regulatory policies are addressed. Practical recommendations for healthcare providers and their patients are outlined. In the final section, suggestions for future research are made to address a number of remaining scientific questions.<n><n>### Response:<n>		According to this task, you should generate the title for this article. While there is much research that supports the link between air pollution and cardiovascular disease, a comprehensive review of the extant medical literature fails to substantiate the causative relationship. Instead, regulation remains largely apolitical and studies continue to show an increased risk for cardiovascular events related to long-term exposure to air pollutants.

The well-paid jobs helped attract many more young people: namely, Afghans who had little access to the formal education system or the nation's formal labor force. Many did not have formal education, but the schools kept educating students. Many continued to be employed in the labor market, because if they were unemployed, their employers wouldn't have the incentive to offer them a better job. In the aftermath of the revolution, many young Afghans gravitated to graft, even though they now faced an uncertain future. Some did return to the country seeking higher-paying jobs. However, some remain very disengaged, preferring to focus on religion or ideologies, as their communities became more unstable and the economy collapsed.

Here is how you could do it. Start by getting a knife and narrow the butter-shaped slice to a small enough size to fit in the knife. This is so the silicone (like bread tape) won't stick to the butter itself. Cut the slice with the cutter like so:<n>Squeeze the slice of butter so that sea salt won't get all over it. Spread this butter over the slice of slice of bread. Note: avoid cutting through the butter. It can make a mess and make you remember to peel ice cream that you ran out of on the day before. Build up the Big Mac recipe. Pour this ontop of the slice of bread. Put it in the freezer for a few minutes. Next, peel all you left large contracting butter sticks from the freezer and drop it into the freezer (stop if it's still brittle)  to melt. Next, peel butter sticks off the tin of the freezer wrapper. Using your knife, cut butter sticks so they fit directly on top of the butter sticks. Cut 1/3 inch down from the middle

That is, five. Jury selection is a fraught process, fraught with high potential biases and complicated on the part of both sides. For modern civil cases, it is arguably even more challenging, because the Inbox app has dramatically simplified jury selection processes, allowing individuals to gather materials for their own Maya 1K dockets (easy or complicated jury duty dockets), making the situation even more complicated for both sides. In most modern civil cases, the judge will consider the credibility of both the prosecuting and defense, and will grant either the villain or the victim, to have their day in court. But it will be two jury members that will determine whether the heinous crime of providing classified information to Petsuito DNA is so atrocious.

Despite these errors and omissions, Chairman Tom Wheeler concluded that his agency should continue to classify broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service and that unclassified access would continue to be treated as such. Enforcement of Title I regulations remains a critical public policy goal, and today's release of the final comments provides further clarity on the agency's position and policy. The agencies with jurisdiction over classified Internet access services: the Federal Communications Commission (fcc), the Federal Trade Commission (ftc), and the Federal Communications Commission (govt). “The communications services or telecommunications services include, but are not limited to, cable TV services that provide access to OTT services of other companies that control access to the actual local broadcast network. Classification of cable TV access services as Title I would require special protections, including mandatory reselling of these services.”  Additionally, the proposed classification of broadband Internet access data access providers as Title II would enable more extensive monitoring of

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, we ask you convert a data table of restaurant descriptions into fluent natural-sounding English sentences. The input is a string of key-value pairs; the output should be a natural and grammatical English sentence containing all the information from the input.<n><n>### Input:<n>name[The Punter], priceRange[moderate], area[riverside], familyFriendly[yes], near[The Portland Arms]<n><n>### Response:<n>		> walking<n>> Near the Portland Arms<n>> near The Portland Arms<n><n>If we look closely, we can see that we're not capturing much information from the input: only the first few items in the string are correctly strings. Fortunately, this is a string search engine, so the machine can pick up the differences. The first character is the word, which normally is dropped. We read from the string, and replace the word with the value from the input. But instead of that, we're capturing the first few words and possibly a few patterns during the pattern recognition. That's a good start: now we can drop redundant words in the string and reconstruct the grammar.<n><n>Another technique we can employ is to use another natural language feature: word frequency. When we look at the string against the pattern generated by word frequency, edge cases seem similar to words of our own language. After all, we're trained from English books to search words of our own language alphabetically, which make sense: words that happen frequently in a string will be be highlighted for you. To re-train this on the string, we can use the word per page pattern recognition from stackoverflow.

Previous research mainly focuses on producing a colored image to match the original one. However, since many colors share the same gray value, an input grayscale image could be diversely colored while maintaining its reality. In this paper, we design a novel solution for unsupervised diverse colorization. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative adversarial networks to model the distribution of real-world item colors, in which we develop a fully convolutional generator with multi-layer noise to enhance diversity, with multi-layer condition concatenation to maintain reality, and with stride 1 to keep spatial information. With such a novel network architecture, the model yields highly competitive performance on the open LSUN bedroom dataset. The Turing test of 80 humans further indicates our generated color schemes are highly convincible.<n><n>### Response:<n>		A grayscale imaged could match the original grayscale but contain many unique dark regions. However, it would still maintain the object's true color. Our reduced inputs can take care of this by performing recursive face detection. We use our Modular Convolutional Emulation (MCNE) network to generate a variant with condition concatenation and with stride 1. We classify a range of intermediate examples into two clearly different colors.

Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>The Bologna criteria for defining poor ovarian response (POR) during IVF provide a useful template for new research in this field of assisted conception. However, designing studies around the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology POR criteria can be methodologically challenging, as the new definition includes various POR subpopulations with diverse baseline characteristics and unknown clinical prognosis. When designing RCTs, potential result bias may be introduced if women from each subpopulation are not evenly allocated between intervention groups. In the case of small or moderate-size RCTs, a single-sequence randomization method may not ensure balanced allocation between groups. Stratified randomization methods provide an alternative methodological approach. Depending on the chosen methodology, patient characteristics and outcomes within each intervention group may be better reported according to relevant subpopulations.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Small or moderate-size Rcts may not be as reliable as larger RCTs, because of potential baseline characteristics or unknown clinical prognosis. Planned randomization may not be adequate.

We develop a robustness metric derived from source-aware lower and upper bounds of model accuracy even when data source labels are not readily available. We clearly demonstrate that even on a well-explored dataset like MNIST, challenging training scenarios can be constructed under the proposed assessment framework for two separate yet equally important applications: i) more rigorous learning model comparison and ii) dataset adequacy evaluation. In addition, our findings not only promise a more complete identification of trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy and robustness but can also help researchers optimize their efforts in data collection by identifying the less robust and more challenging class labels.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We introduce a Novel Resiliently Learning Mapping Framework (NRLMF) to measure the true robusteness of learning models for real world applications by generating sourceinclusive and source exclusive partitions in a dataset via cluster. For both the classification of existing datasets against CLASS labels according to Meese and Engels' theorem and further our identification of trade-offs when comparing models vs. datasets, we use a Source-Only Challenge Learning Framework (STBLF) to manage both, exemplifying this approach in the machine learning world.

Long-term follow-up was obtained in 17. In no case were there any early post-operative complications. All patients stated that they were achieving normal, painless erections; two patients developed a slight penile curvature but this did not affect their sexual activities. We strongly recommend early surgical intervention because of these encouraging results. Urethral injury associated with the fracture did not occur in this series.<n><n>### Response:<n>		This paper describes the case series of 25 patients with fracture of the penile orifice (FCP), and how they describe their functioning post-fracture, with some observations and suggestions on how to best treat patients who have a fracture of the penis. The number of cases in the series is relatively low, but the treatment guidelines have been highly relevant in terms of both the frequency of surgical intervention and the importance of early surgical intervention. Urethritis in one patient had become chronic and the kind and frequency of her urination was becoming bothersome; she had an unusual urinary frequency during meals and many nighttime urinations. She also experienced painful urination 3 days a week, recurring vaginal infections and nausea. Other known symptoms were insomnia, tremor, anxiety and panic attacks. Her primary care provider concluded that she was having a compromised erectile function; she was subsequently imaging in clinics to confirm the diagnosis but no further test could be done. It was allowed that she undertake 12 week of monthly erectile dysfunction therapy. The urethral pharyngeal region was sanitised, aided by chlorhexidine, an anaesthetic aiding in the procedure, and the US Food and Drug Administration approved a 'dry' hypoallergenic enema (for rare gentle cases

Both crises severely impacted the financial stability and health of large economies such as the United States and the Eurozone economies. In terms of financial resources, the crisis dwarfed previous industrial disasters such as the 1993–1994 Gulf War Oil Gulf oil disaster and the Chinese Tiananmen Massacre[4] or the 2008–2009 financial crisis in East Asia such as the 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis,[5] leading to more massive interest rates in the United States than had been seen before.

Compared to previous "best practices" for performing multi-tasking and the similar Quad Core performance of the A56 and A57 series of tablets, the A88 model neither provides multitiative multitasking like competitors like the A57 series nor is as power hungry as a quad core tablet like the iPad Pro. Finally, on a tablet, the existing Lightning speakers provide good sound quality on all but wifi and AMOLED displays, so a headphone jack may present a challenge for some books which have Web-enabled controls.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.<n><n>### Input:<n>Abstract: Five children, aged 6 to 16 years, were tested for unilateral discrimination and interhemispheric transfer of tactile information as well as tactuomotor learning at various intervals before and after therapeutic callosotomy. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children. Bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms. The most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways. The relatively greater deficits observed in the older children, on the other hand, suggest that sensorimotor functions come to depend more extensively on contralateral pathways as the corpus callosum reaches functional maturity.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The 5 children in the study (ages 6 to 16 years) were tested for unilateral discrimination, interhemispheric transfer, and tactuomotor learning. There was evidence that younger children were significantly less impaired by the interruption of callosotomy compared to older children.

Thirteen of the 15 ureters treated showed disappearance of reflux after one injection. The amount of Polytef paste injected varied from 0.2 to 0.9 ml (mean 0.45 ml). There were no complications, except in one ureter where distension of the collecting system was slightly increased compared with the pre-operative urogram.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The main focus of the paper is on the efficacy of endoscopic injections of pyrolised polydextrose paste for treating reflux depression caused by neuropathic bladder infections. The experiment was conducted by Guanglong Hu, MD, a neurosurgeon and a professor of medicine, at Columbia University Medical Center and Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and his colleagues, led by Xiangfei Zhang, MD, a professor of surgery and Jingwen Wang, MD, a professor at Charleston Children's Hospital, who were each affiliated with the NYU Langone Medical Center and Harvard Medical School and affiliated with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, in collaboration with colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital and The University of Massachusetts Medical School. They describe a series of 10 consecutive patients with reflux secondary to reflux caused by neuropathic bladder infection. In all of the 10 patients treated, the cause was initially suspected to be reflux disease secondary to non-specific IgE infection, and, although the etiology was unknown, the treatment was subsequently described as a result of immunoenzymesprimed to recognize and destroy polytetrafluorosilic acid (PTF), which formed a toxic coculture in the bladder that caused a sudden pathological state of reflux and eventually

Many traditional professions were affected by this, with the loss of many professionals involved in the manufacturing, processing and warehousing of products for marketplaces such as Wal-Mart or Amazon. Thousands were left unemployed and abandoned, many lost their ability to own their own homes, often due to evictions. As a result, many ordinary people were left with little to look forward to, or even care about.  Eventually, the resulting despair drove many individuals to seek employment, and many sought out voluntary relocation, often choosing living conditions outside of their home countries due to poverty. Some sought to earn more money in other countries, on the open market, by trading their skills for labor or other heavily discounted commodities, even if these jobs were often for low-skilled work that would scare away potential suitors. Thousands of small businesses were then set up to cater to the needs of these individuals, providing basic services from the illegal trade of services to residents of other regions. A small number of these businesses specialized in helping residents of those countries surrounding Poland, offering kitchen utensils, footwear, home goods, and more.

Significant inhibition of monocyte SA output stimulated with IgG-treated zymosan (ITZ) and fluoride ion (F), but not serum-treated zymosan (STZ) was demonstrated following steroid therapy in RA. No inhibitory effect of prednisolone could be demonstrated in vitro, using ITZ, STZ and F as stimuli. Our data on blood monocyte yields, size and cytochemistry suggest that the in vivo effect is due to a shift in blood monocyte traffic.<n><n>### Response:<n>		RA patients are exposed to high rates of oxidative stress via systemic immunotherapy with conventional anti-tumor agents, such as <n>RA treatment with IgG, which inhibits PAIN-induced thioesterases

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Convert a disfluent question to a proper question. A disfluent question is a question that has some interruptions in it while framing. A proper question is the correct form of the question without any disfluency.<n><n>### Input:<n>How many bits are thought to be a hard problem oops are often in the primes used for RSA public key cryptography algorithms?<n><n>### Response:<n>		There are 23 bits in a public key plus an additional 4 bits for the private/key derivation. You can use this number as the hard problem to generate an RSA public key or digest the basic math to generate a random private key. The trick, though unpopular at the time, was to push the difficulty much further by combining the number of bits required to reconstruct the private key with the difficulty of the actual key. This resulted in a well known public key cryptosystem, called Idemitsu 2, which used only 12 bits to generate encryptions. <n><n>You could start by generating a massive amount of random data to start the initial computation. One approach would be to use the Brian Foster algorithm that splits the number of bits required for a solution into two halves - one first bits, err bits, then tails. Secondly make sure you can reduce the total number of string bits used to get one of sufficient lengths (approximately 2.4 bits). Using this model, you will be able to generate a sufficiently large string result without breaking any cryptography. An additional approach is to use hash table calculations to split the resulting number into halves and hash the result using the optimal sequence of the two halves.<n><n>You will need to approximate the length of string using matrix calculator.

Putin laid out his plans to revitalize Russia's economy before the presidential elections. He told the country's people that the Russia they know would be theirs, under his management. The centerpiece of his reforms was rebuilding Russia's military with new tanks and aircraft.<n><n>War also is a big business for Russia, including in the defense industry. As an avid reader of American newspapers, I had assumed that Russia's military was simply rebranded, with more modern equipment and ready-to-use skills. President Putin guaranteed that the military would be modernized. Along with his own promises, he ordered the conversion of all Soviet-era fighter jets and helicopters into modern military jets. The cost effectiveness of these methods has required Soviet-era military aircraft for sale in the global market. And his measures have provided crucial assurances for his decision to move forward with the construction of additional Russian military bases in Europe. Read two articles detailing the decision, or alternatively, I highly recommend the book by the American journalist Charles Vane. The author Chang Chang Kung Chang has written a 600-page book titled "The Soviet Military from the Cold War to the Twenty-First Century." It details the transformation of Soviet military posture from lethal force to hybrid and post-collapse innovation and production

Examination of the ocular fundus is more difficult. In particular, photography of the central and peripheral parts of the fundus demands additional technical arrangements if all the appearances of biomicroscopy are to be recorded.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Vogt and his colleagues described their method of focusing a laser beam in the invertebrate eye, which can be described as a unique optical method. The technique is similar to what is done in the human visual system with similar capabilities. Several examples of biomicroscopic imaging using experimental setups are described today in a series of papers named the Cell Reports and articles from Nature Biotechnology. These have made Vogt's method readily accessible to bioinformaticians by allowing for trained inventory calculations of (typically) just a couple of key parameters: pupil size, pattern intensity, retinoid status, mode (preserving or re-building the macroscopic images), and the sequence of light hitting the scan. Typical images created for biological studies can be used to guide techniques for later studies, which often require inspecting or reconstructing the entire eye area.

The model, parameterized by Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Processes, overcomes the limitations of previous generative models by allowing fast and accurate inference. We propose an efficient decoding algorithm based on particle filtering that can adapt the beam size to the uncertainty in the model while jointly predicting POS tags and parse trees. The UAS of the parser is on par with that of a greedy discriminative baseline. As a language model, it obtains better perplexity than a n-gram model by performing semi-supervised learning over a large unlabelled corpus. We show that the model is able to generate locally and syntactically coherent sentences, opening the door to further applications in language generation.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We propose a process of using highly accurate, enumerated, and portable particle filtering to generate local and syntactically coherent headlines.

For example, any time we observe evidence that shows different income levels having significantly different impacts on the top of society, but the Journal of Economic Literature has not produced an empirical world where that observation has precedent.<n><n>The current newspaper article focuses exclusively on the topic of income from the top 20% of earners versus the bottom 20% of earners. That seems to capture (at least, historically) both the kind of poverty most people live in, and the level of inequality experienced by the bottom 20% of america families. Even the income of the richest Americans seem to get less than the average family of 4 in most of the world.<n><n>The modern Journal of Economic Literature has produced few real cases, so there really isn't any special relevance to income distribution or other factors.

While finite-horizon DECPOMDPs have enjoyed significant success, progress remains slow for the infinite-horizon case mainly due to the inherent complexity of optimizing stochastic controllers representing agent policies. We present a promising new class of algorithms for the infinite-horizon case, which recasts the optimization problem as inference in a mixture of DBNs. An attractive feature of this approach is the straightforward adoption of existing inference techniques in DBNs for solving DEC-POMDPs and supporting richer representations such as factored or continuous states and actions. We also derive the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize the joint policy represented as DBNs. Experiments on benchmark domains show that EM compares favorably against the state-of-the-art solvers.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Under fifteen words

Using current data from seven sources new reference curves have been estimated from birth to 20 years for children in 1990. The great majority of the data are nationally representative. The analysis used Cole's LMS method and has produced efficient estimates of the conventional centiles and gives a good fit to the data.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We develop a new model for Interactive Question Answering (IQA), using GatedRecurrent-Unit recurrent networks (GRUs) as encoders for statements and questions, and another GRU as a decoder for outputs. Distinct from previous work, our approach employs context-dependent word-level attention for more accurate statement representations and question-guided sentence-level attention for better context modeling. Employing these mechanisms, our model accurately understands when it can output an answer or when it requires generating a supplementary question for additional input. When available, user’s feedback is encoded and directly applied to update sentence-level attention to infer the answer. Extensive experiments on QA and IQA datasets demonstrate quantitatively the effectiveness of our model with significant improvement over conventional QA models.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The problem of generating headline and answering questions for articles is common in the research and development (R&D) industry. Two main approaches have been used for accomplishing this: first, employing the context dependent word level attention mechanism, and then using context dependent word level attention to optimize for user feedback. In our approach, preferred headlines are under fifteen words while other preferred headlines are under fifteen and over fifteen. Newer research results have shown that practicing word level attention leads to improvements in sentence accuracy. Two exploratory experiments examining sentence-level attention in article production already reinforce the efficacy of our approach. On QA, we apply user feedback directly to improve passage accuracy.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>The AGM theory of belief revision has be­ come an important paradigm for investigat­ ing rational belief changes. Unfortunately, researchers working in this paradigm have re­ stricted much of their attention to rather sim­ ple representations of belief states, namely logically closed sets of propositional sen­ tences. In our opinion, this has resulted in a too abstract categorisation of belief change operations: expansion, revision, or contrac­ tion. Occasionally, in the AGM paradigm, also probabilistic belief changes have been considered, and it is widely accepted that the probabilistic version of expansion is con­ ditioning. However, we argue that it may be more correct to view conditioning and expan­ sion as two essentially different kinds of belief change, and that what we call constraining is a better candidate for being considered prob­ abilistic expansion.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The AGM model of belief reverberation is most often associated with the probabilistic subject belief changes judg ment, and for a reason: by using a less abstract model of belief change, the focus is on the positivity and predictability of belief states, rather than the possibility of actual belief change. Another reason we think of physical belief changes—as opposed to purely experiential contact with a belief state—is that past research has shown the latter to influence the accessibility of further belief changes. We think revisiting these model concepts can be used to guide further search for constraints on our searches for likelihood of belief change, and for understanding the conditions under which new information about belief may emerge.

The iceberg taste... the shavings in the sauce... the vicious crunching of the potato prices... the alchemy made this fish salad so tasty. As we sipped our water, barflies swam by.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We tackle the problem of inferring node labels in a partially labeled graph where each node in the graph has multiple label types and each label type has a large number of possible labels. Our primary example, and the focus of this paper, is the joint inference of label types such as hometown, current city, and employers, for users connected by a social network. Standard label propagation fails to consider the properties of the label types and the interactions between them. Our proposed method, called EDGEEXPLAIN, explicitly models these, while still enabling scalable inference under a distributed message-passing architecture. On a billion-node subset of the Facebook social network, EDGEEXPLAIN significantly outperforms label propagation for several label types, with lifts of up to 120% for recall@1 and 60% for recall@3.<n><n>### Response:<n>		EDGEEXPLAIN can outperform conventional label propagation in a fully labeled graph.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.<n><n>### Input:<n>Abstract: A graphic representation of the micturition cycle by a pressure-volume plot has been obtained in 120 women, both incontinent patients and normal controls. The pattern of contraction during voiding allowed prediction of the outcome of treatment. Patients with urethral sphincter incompetence and a sustained detrusor contraction had a good result from colposuspension even if detrusor instability was found during filling. Where the urethral sphincter was competent, patients with urge incontinence with or without detrusor instability during filling cystometry had a good response to drugs, providing a sustained detrusor contraction was present during voiding. Urethral sphincter incompetence was characterised by a low detrusor voiding pressure.<n><n>### Response:<n>		This paper presents the results of a pioneering study into the management of women with urinary incontinence using both routine colpossectomy and with  controlled voiding. The longest terminating hiatus before the bladder emptying was considered to be completely resolved by conventional vascular fistula repair, however the resection of the sphincter resulted in a weak microenvironment and had unintended consequences such as causing poor outcome. Thus, women who were able to complete voiding without pathological detrusor collapse during filling had a promising prognosis.<n><n>Surprisingly, women with urinary incontinent women were not only unsuccessful in managing their disease, but could even be experiencing distress and suggesting that their bladder was becoming diluted and could not adequately contain the weight of the incontinence (more on this later). This discovery provided a novel and unexpected way to obtain a good outcome even in women with detrusor instability and penned the trail for future research into the management of urethritis, septicaemia, and bladder function.

The sentence also fails to capture the complexity of the story and its many implications. It is clear that there is more than one version of the same story — the British Experiment was in fact undertaken by several nations. At the same time, it is clear to me that the British truly did not gain knowledge of French nor to understand the nature of conflict or world politics as a whole. The British did not even gain knowledge of the French. On the contrary, the British deliberately left out important pieces of history, have invented absurd imaginary allies, and have intentionally engaged in systematic espionage that has splintered European societies. It is therefore hard to discern what the real aims of the British in conducting the Experiment were and what consequences they might have had for European domestic life.

This problem may be even worse for postgraduate students who are new to a field and may not know where to start. To address this problem, we have developed an online catalog of research papers where the papers have been automatically categorized by a topic model. The catalog contains 7719 papers from the proceedings of two artificial intelligence conferences from 2000 to 2015. Rather than the commonly used Latent Dirichlet Allocation, we use a recently proposed method called hierarchical latent tree analysis for topic modeling. The resulting topic model contains a hierarchy of topics so that users can browse the topics from the top level to the bottom level. The topic model contains a manageable number of general topics at the top level and allows thousands of fine-grained topics at the bottom level. It also can detect topics that have emerged recently.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The topic model contains a hierarchy with topics at the top level, and thousands of fine-grain topics at the bottom level

We have assessed HPRT mutants in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with connective tissue diseases who have been treated for long periods with cytotoxic drugs. The results from patients treated with cyclophosphamide were abnormal suggesting the presence of drug-induced mutations. The results from patients treated with chlorambucil or azathioprine did not differ from controls--either these drugs have not induced mutations or, more likely, the technique is not sufficiently sensitive to detect them. These possibilities are discussed. Specific mutations induced by cytotoxic drugs in patients with connective tissue diseases have not been previously recorded.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The research team has identified a class-2 HPRT mutant in patients with chronic connective tissue disease (CFTD) who have undergone therapy with cytotoxic drugs, but have not been shown to have mutations in their functional HPRT locus. We have previously shown that the suppression of thioguanamine-induced mutations by the cytotoxic drugs chlorambucil and azathioprine, as well as by thiocyanates, contribute to abnormal results in experimental models of CFTD. These results suggest that drug-induced mutations may not be present in patients with CFTD. Specific mutations may be present in patients treated with cytotoxic drugs and have not been previously shown.

All 100 teams compete in a single event. This event was founded by Adolf Wüstendmann, a German physiologist, during the 1904 Olympic games in Berlin in which several thousand athletes tested positive for banned substances such as testosterone. It’s believed athletics have developed a symbiotic relationship with doping—both deterring competitors and encouraging healthy participation by athletes.<n><n>In order to be eligible to participate in the olympics, athletes must have achieved a qualifying goal set by their country, attend the 1936 games in Berlin, participate in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, receive all necessary accreditation, and receive clearance from the National Olympic Committee (NOC) before competition begins. Athletes wishing to compete should first apply for NOC memberships, and then begin to earn a coveted medal certification. Subsequent to the 1936 Olympics, athletes receive an additional letter declaring them eligible to compete at any Olympics—a first USOC member medal.<n><n>The 1936 Olympics in Berlin took place between 1932 and 1936. The 1936 games were followed by the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Then athletes competed in the 1936 Olympics in yet another 28 events throughout the rest of the year, until 1940.

Otherwise it would it be a perfect replacement for my old modem that broke down<n><n>### Response:<n>		After reading many positive reviews I decided to upgrade my internet connection. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the performance. The performance was incredibly slow and unstable, causing me to have to revert to dial-up all the time. Instead, I switched providers, and now access is still sporadic and slow. My current ISP recommended upgrading, but at $80/mo, it's a steep price to pay for a feature that I rarely use. My home is located in an area with lots of internet access. I use the Internet frequently, and as a result, cannot experience even the slightest degree of connectivity problems. I have a 1-year-old son who spends most of his time playing, and running around, that network. Given my state of being, I've invested a lot to upgrade my internet connection, and I don't want to wait a year or more to see the results. I recommend anyone doing the same, as upgrading to fibre or DSL has a significant increase in speed, stability, and predictability.

The type II prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas adaptive immune system has been shown to facilitate RNA-guided site-specific DNA cleavage. We engineered two different type II CRISPR/Cas systems and demonstrate that Cas9 nucleases can be directed by short RNAs to induce precise cleavage at endogenous genomic loci in human and mouse cells. Cas9 can also be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with minimal mutagenic activity. Lastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided nuclease technology.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The short version is that you are generating the title for the article by editing the article to generate a homology-directed repair guide sequence.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is used in virtually all state-of-the-art object detection pipelines. While essential object detection ingredients such as features, classifiers, and proposal methods have been extensively researched surprisingly little work has aimed to systematically address NMS. The de-facto standard for NMS is based on greedy clustering with a fixed distance threshold, which forces to trade-off recall versus precision. We propose a convnet designed to perform NMS of a given set of detections. We report experiments on a synthetic setup, and results on crowded pedestrian detection scenes. Our approach overcomes the intrinsic limitations of greedy NMS, obtaining better recall and precision.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Our approach improves recall and precision over existing methods and approaches. In summary, our work has identified new techniques that can improve detection of NMS.

The first section isn't particularly difficult, but generates a mischievous headline:  <n> "Thomas Edison: Why His invention changed the world"<n>The second paragraph  is a fruitless, though familiar, exercise: <n><n>   "Why His invention changed the world?", introducing the author as a new person, "then named James Clerk Maxwell as a scientific father for several inventions without which the social fabric of history would likely have collapsed."<n><n>The hindrance is decision reuse. Do you want to guess the correct sentence, or do you let the pronoun stand? This is a highly prone task, especially in autoregressive text generation. Make a conscious decision to create headlines based on expert opinion, or use a shortcut to state the exact text you want to generate.

However, so far no drug against HIV-1 infection exhibiting this mechanism of action has been approved. To identify new potent candidates for inhibitors, we performed in silico screening of a commercial database of more than 1,300 drug-like compounds by using receptorbased docking studies. The candidates selected from docking studies were subsequently tested using biological assays to assess anti-HIV activities. As a result, two compounds were identified as the most active. Specifically, both exhibited anti-HIV activity against viral replication at a low concentration and relatively low cytotoxicity at the effective concentration inhibiting viral growth by 50 %.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Cyclophin A, a known human immunodeficiency virus bearing this mechanism of action, is targeting the emerging target as the next target of anti-human Immunodeficiency viruses.

To do this you should remember the password you set earlier in your account and then create a new password using the combination of those two letters. Check that password using a browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox which can be installed on your computer or Mac. Once you're prompted to confirm, hit Return to open the Gmail UI. Next, to view your newly created password, click the "New Password" link. Once you're done viewing passwords, poor gmail will automatically show a warning stating the password has been changed and that you need to provide new information! The only reason gmail doesn't auto-recover your password is that it's configured not to return the password once it expires, which is why you need to encrypt your password before logging into your account.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>In this paper, we investigate whether an a priori disambiguation of word senses is strictly necessary or whether the meaning of a word in context can be disambiguated through composition alone. We evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf singlevector and multi-sense vector models on a benchmark phrase similarity task and a novel task for word-sense discrimination. We find that single-sense vector models perform as well or better than multi-sense vector models despite arguably less clean elementary representations. Our findings furthermore show that simple composition functions such as pointwise addition are able to recover sense specific information from a single-sense vector model remark-<n><n>### Response:<n>		While a priori disambigation of word senses may provide a cleaner algorithm, on-the-shelf vector models emerge from the data bloat of other large AI programs like Bing or Microsoft Word with similar features. Hence, a large-scale disambiguation of words is not necessary in order to perform word-sense discrimination. In contrast, an elementary representation of a word may still yield usable information when the word sense source has as few as a few terms.

In obese individuals, adipose tissue releases increased amounts of non-esterified fatty acids, glycerol, hormones, pro-inflammatory cytokines and other factors that are involved in the development of insulin resistance. When insulin resistance is accompanied by dysfunction of pancreatic islet β-cells — the cells that release insulin — failure to control blood glucose levels results. Abnormalities in β-cell function are therefore critical in defining the risk and development of type 2 diabetes. This knowledge is fostering exploration of the molecular and genetic basis of the disease and new approaches to its treatment and prevention.<n><n>### Response:<n>		This article is titled: Obesity and type 2 diabetes.  The article also mentions that when insulin resistance develops, this can be linked to abnormalities in β-cell function.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>In the fashion industry, order scheduling focuses on the assignment of production orders to appropriate production lines. In reality, before a new order can be put into production, a series of activities known as pre-production events need to be completed. In addition, in real production process, owing to various uncertainties, the daily production quantity of each order is not always as expected. In this research, by considering the pre-production events and the uncertainties in the daily production quantity, robust order scheduling problems in the fashion industry are investigated with the aid of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) called nondominated sorting adaptive differential evolution (NSJADE). The experimental results illustrate that it is of paramount importance to consider pre-production events in order scheduling problems in the fashion industry. We also unveil that the existence of the uncertainties in the daily production quantity heavily affects the order scheduling.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Based on the experimental results, it is of paramount importance for order scheduling to account for pre-production events. Specifically, based on the MOA approach, the existence of the uncertainties (known as uncertainties in the daily production quantities) significantly impacts the order scheduling problem in the fashion industry as well as in other real production process.

We were unable to show any abnormality in the excretion of Zn, Mg or GAG. In 11 patients, a low level of urinary citrate was a significant feature that was associated in most cases with a urinary pH value above 6. Citrate concentration (per litre) and output (per 24 h) were found to be lower than in the controls in 19 and 33% respectively of the determinations. The overall ratio of average urinary citrate concentration in patients and controls was 0.56, a figure in agreement with previous data.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The inhibition of urinary stone formation was studied in 20 normal control and 40 recurrent calcium stone forming patients.
