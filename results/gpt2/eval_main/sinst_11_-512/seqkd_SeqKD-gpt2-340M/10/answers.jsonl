Stream of job postings birthed flame wars: fierce competition between companies looking to hire this new breed of yahtzee artist.  \nThe harassment began: friends refused to identify themselves for fear of retribution.  A lockdown imposed.  Motherboards hacked into colleagues' Twitter accounts attempting to identify each other, with more hacks coming in.\nFirst, cone cancer"}

The decision has enormous implications for the course of the UK's international and domestic policy, as it will influence its relationship with other member states, the Commonwealth and beyond as well as have implications for public administration, social security and the economy.\n\nIf the UK votes to leave the European Union in a referendum vote, the implications for UK society and economy could be extremely serious. A decision to withdraw from the union could result in a loss of living standards, job losses, uncertainty over the nature of future working arrangements, social welfare cuts, beatings or imprisonments, economic uncertainty and strains on consumer confidence. Losing access to the single market and having to pay higher import tariffs for exports could also severely impact negatively on the consumer price of goods. Leaving the EU also risks a loss of control over its borders and its threat to take trade policy away from national parliaments would likely increase uncertainty and tariffs for UK goods. Any further peg or departure from the EU may be difficult to negotiate with member states, and other countries might not similarly take a quick or aggressive approach toward the UK, limiting UK exports.

By threatening invasion, the Soviets would force either Poland's capitulation or outright destruction. Hitler, however, attacked the USSR before the invasion, and had an open hand in the matter. The rationale behind s.f.foreign policy took shape in the belief that itmight succeed if the Western democracies used aggressive strategies like Glasnost in East Germany and criticized the Soviet government over perceived Soviet exploitation of eastern European resources. This education on the \u201cwhy\u201d of foreign policy was used to justify the USSR\u201ds continued use of the policy once Hitler began his invasion. Versidencies between the Western democracies led to an increased demand for U.S. military intervention in international crises.

Yet, the article mentions that there were times that the participants were unable to correctly identify between chad and pakistan in the text. There were multiple instances where the participants couldn't correctly pick which province q of pakistan belongs to. And other examples in which the participants incorrectly wrote in gibberish.\n\nUntil now, establishing that the article is correctcept in this particular task would require the participants to read it several times mentally on a four day stretch. Yet, given that the article is largely unchanged between the two tester days, broken sentences, and a lack of clarity in the text especially when comparing strength score between chad and paks, it is clear that this text is of excessively low quality.

Eating at this famous restaurant has become a special treat for generations of young people in Japan. The restaurant is located on the main island of Saitama, which is also famous for its nightlife in a bar called the Wanna-be. It is on the seashore of a tropical ocean.\n\nWhile Silicone Sea Football is on, the owner of the restaurant, Morihei Ueshiba, offered a very rare offer, a table where you could eat seafood and a pasta sauce under a warm tent.  \n\nAt first, everyone hesitated, but now everyone is really open to the offer, and it was not beneath him to offer this opportunity. Morihei knew that when the dishwasher went out and fixed the ceiling tiles, he could use this opportunity to sell out the reservation, and expect a very large quantity of customers."}

It is hypothesized as a product of mechanical stress and inflammation that greater prevalence of progressive anaphylaxis, immune failure, immune stimulation and immune dysfunction[7] leading to pathological inflammation, may account for improvement in his condition. Episodic arthritis (also known as episodic arthritis, intermittent anaphylaxis, recurrent anaphylaxis, and recurrent anaphylaxis) is a severe form of chronic pelvic pain that most commonly occurs despite treatment with medications, typically steroids.

The owner wants to help the locals by opening an uber station in the neighborhood and offering a better menu. The author walks up to the counter, and a woman behind the counter offers a sneak peak at the uber menu and asks for her address. The author is able to take a grocery order and get the full review. The author then walks over to a small table, where a large steak cut comes out for her and she passes twelve people. She orders a plate of steak and chips with chips. Three people turn to see the huge steak that came out yesterday and a customer asks her how she knows the price and says it was late yesterday  and the steak was tasty.

By combining efficiency and generative models for exploring sparse graph patterns, we are able to arrive at a soft minimum subset.\nThough incommensurate with the publication date or other circumstances, optimal headlines would only contain title and abstract (e.g., \"a fuzzy graph algorithm\"). Ideally you will avoid frequent references to the graph, which limits your generator's generative capabilities. Inputs that link to the article such as a topic heading or image are preferably hidden in the text of your best-case headlines."}

This probability is based on a coin flip where each side will put the number of turns before each other to determine the result.  For example 4 comes down to 21, so the probability that it will come down to 4 is 1/5.  \n\nYou can use simple sentence construction to avoid this type of problem by simply using the word roll and phrases like 4-21 to make the question clearer. \n\nIf the die is smaller than 4, what is the probability of it not being equal to 4? \nThis probability can be calculated by rolling the die 6 times and landing on 4 since that is the smallest possible roll result.   For example 4 / 6 = 81% so the probability that the die does not equal 4 (assuming the number of turns before playing a coin flip is equal to 1) is 81% leaving the probability that it equal 4 1/4, meaning 81% \u2014 roll 6 times, and your probability of the die not equal 4 is 1/4."}

A proposed mechanism for this inhibition is suggested by experimental evidence showing that a weak, high-activity PEG-1/\u03b1 th2 inhibitor inhibits the proliferation of T cell lines constitutent for hypodermic shock. Although a strong negative correlation (r=-.29) was found between the PI3K/A and pMHC activity, these data are diluted by studies of PMH-activated pMHC inhibitory properties. In summary, our data show that a weakly expressed peptide lacks central activation symptoms or physiological activity. As a result, inhibition of T cell activity may be dependent on contributions from complex interplay of factors underlying these observations."}

Additionally, in this bill, establish an Women\u2019 History and Nineteenth Amendment centennial quarter dollar coin program.    Appraisers will receive laces for the weight commemorating these pivotal moments in American history.   This project is targeted at the women's history and minority population in America particularly focused in statehood.   The focus will be on the financial contributions of women and children and to coin the Quarter-Dollar coin, removing the need to strike bullion and making the issue of silver more readily available.  \n\nPlease forward this to your colleagues asking for similar legislation.   This legislation is bipartisan and reflects the deep commitment of many members of Congress to advancing full equality for women and children.   This legislation also serves as a powerful reminder to the nation and to those in positions of power that promoting women\u2019s pride and inclusion should not serve as a means only for progress.  \nIt simply wouldn\u2019t work."}

We show that binding cooperative mechanisms, which have not been considered in detail\nin this context, can combine to form fusions that blur the line between oscillatory versus non-oscillatory behaviors. As these fusions cause the loop to act at the same time, providing a stunningly efficient control of circadian behavior.\n\nWe discuss mechanisms through mechanisms that behave as fusions and discuss their implications for our understanding of circadian control and evolution, as well as for understanding problems with the construction of self-reproducing networks that conform to our current understanding of how these mechanisms work. \n\nFurther Considerations\nThe findings that are summarized here can generate a good summary of a promising area of research into circadian clock regulation.

The most common reason is found in semiconductor transistors and in switching mechanisms such as bipolar transistors and piezoelectric transistors.  When one junction is conducting current, the operation of a switch operates by separating the suppression current flowing through the second junction from the current flowing through the first junction.  Conversely, when the active junction is conducting current only a very small amount (typically only a few amperes or milliamps) the suppression current flows through.  As a consequence, the operation of a transistor (within its schematically labeled bipolar transistor) is directed at the desiring rate of the circuit, which is often one transistor at a time, and the then closely follow pruning of sufficient modules to reach the desired output."}

Many continued to be employed in the labor market, because if they were unemployed, their employers wouldn't have the incentive to offer them a better job. In the aftermath of the revolution, many young Afghans gravitated to graft, even though they now faced an uncertain future. Some did return to the country seeking higher-paying jobs.

After several tries, he finally wins her over with a \"BRING IT!\" and leaves the restaurant.\nMichael leaves the restaurant, hungry and frustrated.

In terms of financial resources, the crisis dwarfed previous industrial disasters such as the 1993\u20131994 Gulf War Oil Gulf oil disaster and the Chinese Tiananmen Massacre[4] or the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis in East Asia such as the 2008\u20132009 Global Financial Crisis,[5] leading to more massive interest rates in the United States than had been seen before. The crisis, along with its complexity and scale, significantly damaged the reputation of many institutions responsible for financial stability, including Canadian financial institutions,[6] credit rating agencies, and ratings agencies such as Moody's and Fitch.[7] Furthermore, the collapse of the"}

(Oliver lindsey). \n\nIn every subsequent iteration of that American tale, she's been portrayed as the de facto heir to her father's throne, racking up increasingly more accomplishments while her mother worked to earn sustenance.  \n\nWhy, despite possessing almost-identical physical characteristics, is Lindsay the third person to take over her mother's throne?  The story is completely divided into two separate and conflicting storylines, requiring precious little imagination to understand one from the other.  \n\nBut the question still seems to be asked, and the answer, while interesting, shifts the nature of the question and leaves open the questioner with a difficult choice: is mommy already dead or is she still alive, or is she the dead one who still needs to live and go through this very important thing"}

Many traditional professions were affected by this, with the loss of many professionals involved in the manufacturing, processing and warehousing of products for marketplaces such as Wal-Mart or Amazon. Thousands were left unemployed and abandoned, many lost their ability to own their own homes, often due to evictions. As a result, many ordinary people were left with little to look forward to, or even care about.  Eventually, the resulting despair drove many individuals to seek employment, and many sought out voluntary relocation, often choosing living conditions outside of their home countries due to poverty. Some sought to earn more money in other countries, on the open market, by trading their skills for labor or other heavily discounted commodities, even if these jobs were often for low-skilled work that would scare away potential suitors. Thousands of small businesses were then set up to cater to the needs of these individuals, providing basic services from the illegal trade of services to residents of other regions. A small number of these businesses specialized in helping residents of those countries surrounding Poland, offering kitchen utensils, footwear, home goods, and more.

{"text": "There are 23 bits in a public key plus an additional 4 bits for the private/key derivation. You can use this number as the hard problem to generate an RSA public key or digest the basic math to generate a random private key. The trick, though unpopular at the time, was to push the difficulty much further by combining the number of bits required to reconstruct the private key with the difficulty of the actual key. This resulted in a well known public key cryptosystem, called Idemitsu 2, which used only 12 bits to generate encryptions. \n\nYou could start by generating a massive amount of random data to start the initial computation. One approach would be to use the Brian Foster algorithm that splits the number of bits required for a solution into two halves - one first bits, err bits, then tails. Secondly make sure you can reduce the total number of string bits used to get one of sufficient lengths (approximately 2.4 bits). Using this model, you will be able to generate a sufficiently large string result without breaking any cryptography. An additional approach is to use hash table calculations to split the resulting number into halves and hash the result using the optimal sequence of the two halves.\n\nYou will need to approximate the length of string using matrix calculator."}

For example, any time we observe evidence that shows different income levels having significantly different impacts on the top of society, but the Journal of Economic Literature has not produced an empirical world where that observation has precedent.\n\nThe current newspaper article focuses exclusively on the topic of income from the top 20% of earners versus the bottom 20% of earners. That seems to capture (at least, historically) both the kind of poverty most people live in, and the level of inequality experienced by the bottom 20% of america families. Even the income of the richest Americans seem to get less than the average family of 4 in most of the world.\n\nThe modern Journal of Economic Literature has produced few real cases, so there really isn't any special relevance to income distribution or other factors. However, the number of articles has helped persons prospective in this area, and helped generate whitewashed quotes from high networth individuals. The lack of today's diversity in this area is surprising."}

China's state-run media have condemned the fighting as \"self-defence\" and called for the \u201cpeaceful resolution of the trouble\u201d. But critics say the government of Indira Gandhi has no obligation to show mercy to the insurgents. China for its part has consistently imposed economic penalties and restrictions on several groups, including smaller ones that criticize Communist Party leadership. China's state-backed news media have glorified and glorified Mao Zedong, its founder and current leader, increasingly making fun of his transgressions against the law himself.Production is underway across the state-owned enterprises to publish the ensuing catfishes. Editing errors triggered various warnings on Saturday from Chinese regulators about unauthorised usage of official news media content. Malicious content suspected of violating regulations is reported to be purged from the servers of state-owned media organisations such as Baidu and Tencent."}

At first glance, I was confused by X's menu: traditional Chinese staples such as fried potatoes, fried eggs, and pumpkin soup were not available. I decided to try something new: oysters. They were delicious and fresh, and so was the food. I nodded my head knowingly, but felt a small shiver down my spine. I was in for an unpleasant experience when my food arrived. The iceberg taste... the shavings in the sauce... the vicious crunching of the potato prices... the alchemy made this fish salad so tasty. As we sipped our water, barflies swam by. The servers kept coming back to order the Oyster Man, which I couldn't resist. We all giggled and tried on almost every item, but knew we were about to eat our last dinner."}

The longest terminating hiatus before the bladder emptying was considered to be completely resolved by conventional vascular fistula repair, however the resection of the sphincter resulted in a weak microenvironment and had unintended consequences such as causing poor outcome. Thus, women who were able to complete voiding without pathological detrusor collapse during filling had a promising prognosis.\n\nSurprisingly, women with urinary incontinent women were not only unsuccessful in managing their disease, but could even be experiencing distress and suggesting that their bladder was becoming diluted and could not adequately contain the weight of the incontinence (more on this later). This discovery provided a novel and unexpected way to obtain a good outcome even in women with detrusor instability and penned the trail for future research into the management of urethritis, septicaemia, and bladder function."}

It\u2019s believed athletics have developed a symbiotic relationship with doping\u2014both deterring competitors and encouraging healthy participation by athletes.\n\nIn order to be eligible to participate in the olympics, athletes must have achieved a qualifying goal set by their country, attend the 1936 games in Berlin, participate in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, receive all necessary accreditation, and receive clearance from the National Olympic Committee (NOC) before competition begins. Athletes wishing to compete should first apply for NOC memberships, and then begin to earn a coveted medal certification. Subsequent to the 1936 Olympics, athletes receive an additional letter declaring them eligible to compete at any Olympics\u2014a first USOC member medal.\n\nThe 1936 Olympics in Berlin took place between 1932 and 1936. The 1936 games were followed by the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Then athletes competed in the 1936 Olympics in yet another 28 events throughout the rest of the year, until 1940."}

{"text": "After reading many positive reviews I decided to upgrade my internet connection. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the performance. The performance was incredibly slow and unstable, causing me to have to revert to dial-up all the time. Instead, I switched providers, and now access is still sporadic and slow. My current ISP recommended upgrading, but at $80/mo, it's a steep price to pay for a feature that I rarely use. My home is located in an area with lots of internet access. I use the Internet frequently, and as a result, cannot experience even the slightest degree of connectivity problems. I have a 1-year-old son who spends most of his time playing, and running around, that network. Given my state of being, I've invested a lot to upgrade my internet connection, and I don't want to wait a year or more to see the results. I recommend anyone doing the same, as upgrading to fibre or DSL has a significant increase in speed, stability, and predictability."}
