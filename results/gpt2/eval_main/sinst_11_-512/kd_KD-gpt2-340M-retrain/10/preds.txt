Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task you're given a question and you have to paraphrase the question to create the output question while retaining the meaning of the original question.<n><n>### Input:<n>Is there such a thing as a political center? How does it look like and can it be achieved?<n><n>### Response:<n>		There is no clear center, but there are multiple reference points that could provide insight. The first reference is the United States Constitution, which notes that "the powers of the executive branch, shall be vested in a President of the United States." This is interpreted as a legislative reference point. The Constitution also notes that "the powers shall not be exercised by the President alone, but Congress shall have concurrent jurisdiction over the subject." This would make clear that the Judicial and Legislative branches would have concurrent jurisdiction over the issue. Another reference is to the Federal Reserve, which notes that "one set of regulations may supersede others." This would make clear the Judicial and Legislative branches have concurrent jurisdiction over the regulation. <n><n>Preserving the meaning of the original problem can be challenging, but the result of correctly identifying a center can often be achieved through a combination of clear reference points, historical documents, and user input.

Complete blood volume (BCV) is defined as the volume of  the plasma volume reabsorbed by the mature liver within a few hours after the fetus is born. Bilirubin is a well-tolerated, short-acting, single-molecule anti-hemoperfusion therapy for premature infants that was successfully performed for the primary outcome--drying the infant's hemoperfusion.

DNA vaccines are currently used in veterinary medicine, but have not achieved widespread acceptance for use in humans due to their low immunogenicity in early clinical studies. However, recent clinical data have re-established the value of DNA vaccines, particularly in priming high-level antigenspecific antibody responses. Several approaches have been investigated for improving DNA vaccine efficacy, including advancements in DNA vaccine vector design, the inclusion of genetically engineered cytokine adjuvants, and novel non-mechanical delivery methods. These strategies have shown promise, resulting in augmented adaptive immune responses in not only mice, but also in large animal models. Here, we review advancements in each of these areas that show promise for increasing the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines.<n><n>### Response:<n>		DNA vaccines are currently used in clinical research, but have not reached mass acceptance for use in humans.

The policy is to prevent streamers from submitting highly rated games to compete against each other, and has led to significant gameplay bugs and other problems with the game. N.O.V is a complex, historically accurate movie that is widely regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time.

These cases are unusual in that renal metastases are usually silent lesions discovered at autopsy. Review of the autopsy data from this hospital identified renal metastases in 19% of patients who died from carcinoma of the lung. This incidence parallels that of other series. A solid renal lesion which is identified in a patient with a history of pulmonary carcinoma should raise the suspicion of renal metastases, especially if computed tomography of the mass demonstrates relative homogeneity and minimal enhancement. More frequent use of the abdominal CT scan in staging patients with lung cancer will render metastatic carcinoma from lung to kidney a more frequent ante mortem diagnosis.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Carcinomas found at autopsy suggest renal metastases.

Here we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models. We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected. We estimate how transmission parameters varied through time, highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species. Predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of GB are presented for the fitted models.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Although intensive ongoing research has identified many aspects of the spatial-structural evolution of the 2001 foot disease (FMD) outbreak in Great Britain, key aspects of the temporal evolution of the 2001 foot remain unexplained.

This observation does not invalidate the concept of functional groupings within these anterior horn cell pools. In studies of the same segment in cords obtained at autopsy from patients with motor neuron disease, zones of focal loss of motor neurons were identified, without consistent severity or distribution at different sectional levels. These findings imply varying resistance to the disease in different pools of motor neurons.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Given the abstract, I will describe the central idea of this paper, which is illustrated in the titles of individual papers.

This dynamic structure physically connects neighboring epithelial cells, couples intercellular adhesive contacts to the cytoskeleton, and helps define each cell's apical-basal axis. Together these activities coordinate the form, polarity, and function of all cells in an epithelium. Several molecules regulate AJ formation and integrity, including Rho family GTPases and Par polarity proteins. However, only recently, with the development of live-cell imaging, has the extent to which E-cadherin is actively turned over at junctions begun to be appreciated. This turnover contributes to junction formation and to the maintenance of epithelial integrity during tissue homeostasis and remodeling.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Title for article is under thirty words.

At each timestep, zoneout stochastically forces some hidden units to maintain their previous values. Like dropout, zoneout uses random noise to train a pseudo-ensemble, improving generalization. But by preserving instead of dropping hidden units, gradient information and state information are more readily propagated through time, as in feedforward stochastic depth networks. We perform an empirical investigation of various RNN regularizers, and find encouraging results: zoneout gives significant performance improvements across tasks, yielding state-ofthe-art results in character-level language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset and competitive results on word-level Penn Treebank and permuted sequential MNIST classification tasks.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Zoneout is a novel method for regularising RNNs.

To make encoder-decoder models more flexible, attention mechanism was introduced to machine translation and also other tasks like speech recognition and image captioning. We observe that the quality of translation by attention-based encoder-decoder can be significantly damaged when the alignment is incorrect. We attribute these problems to the lack of distortion and fertility models. Aiming to resolve these problems, we propose new variations of attention-based encoderdecoder and compare them with other models on machine translation. Our proposed method achieved an improvement of 2 BLEU points over the original attentionbased encoder-decoder.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We propose new variations of attention - based encoder-decoder and compare them to other models on machine translation

Your task is to write a question that clarifies the given question in such a way that the generated question has one unique answer.<n><n>### Input:<n>Where do historians believe the black death originated?<n><n>### Response:<n>		The answer depends on when one defines "black death".

However, this answer would not match the historical record, since the first mention of the black death appears six centuries later in Annals of Witchcraft and Wizardry, written by Johannes Verwandt.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Recently deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to learn speaker features. However, the quality of the learned features is not sufficiently good, so a complex back-end model, either neural or probabilistic, has to be used to address the residual uncertainty when applied to speaker verification, just as with raw features. This paper presents a convolutional timedelay deep neural network structure (CT-DNN) for speaker feature learning. Our experimental results on the Fisher database demonstrated that this CT-DNN can produce highquality speaker features: even with a single feature (0.3 seconds including the context), the EER can be as low as 7.68%.

While MF based models have been extensively exploited in the graph modeling and link prediction literature, the AE family has not gained much attention. In this paper we investigate both MF and AE’s application to the link prediction problem in sparse graphs. We show the connection between AE and MF from the perspective of multiview learning, and further propose MF+AE: a model training MF and AE jointly with shared parameters. We apply dropout to training both the MF and AE parts, and show that it can significantly prevent overfitting by acting as an adaptive regularization. We conduct experiments on six real world sparse graph datasets, and show that MF+AE consistently outperforms the competing methods, especially on datasets that demonstrate strong non-cohesive structures.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In this task you are given a part  of an article.

However, for more realistic and more complex models than those assuming homogeneous mixing in the population, other threshold quantities can be defined that are sometimes more useful and easily derived in terms of model parameters. In this paper, we present a model for the spread of a permanently immunizing infection in a population socially structured into households and workplaces/schools, and we propose and discuss a new household-to-household reproduction number R H for it. We show how R H overcomes some of the limitations of a previously proposed threshold parameter, and we highlight its relationship with the effort required to control an epidemic when interventions are targeted at randomly selected households.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The research paper you are reading is "Bioinformatics: Establishing the Role of Heterogeneous Strain in the Spread of an Immune-Condition" by Tettelin et al.

The factors that determine the stimulatory potency of a pMHC molecule remain unclear. We describe results showing that a peptide exhibiting many hallmarks of a weak agonist stimulates T cells to proliferate more than the wild-type agonist ligand. An in silico approach suggested that the inability to form the central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) could underlie the increased proliferation. This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed that enhancing cSMAC formation reduced stimulatory capacity of the weak peptide. Our studies highlight the fact that a complex interplay of factors determines the quality of a T cell antigen.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Title for article is under thirty words

We compiled several relevant and appropriate requirement quality attributes and sentence rules from previous literatures and adopt it to come out with a set of ambiguity attributes that most suit Malay words. The extracted Malay ambiguous words (potential) are then being mapped onto the constructed ambiguity attributes to confirm their vagueness. The list is then verified by Malay linguist experts. This paper aims to identify a list of potential ambiguous words in Malay as an attempt to assist writers to avoid using the vague words while documenting Malay Requirement Specification as well as to any other related Malay documentation. The result of this study is a list of 120 potential ambiguous Malay words that could act as guidelines in writing Malay sentences.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We recommend using the following approach to identify ambiguous Malay words:<n><n>1.

The fundamental reason is the difficulty of backpropagation through discrete random variables combined with the inherent instability of the GAN training objective. To address these problems, we propose Maximum-Likelihood Augmented Discrete Generative Adversarial Networks. Instead of directly optimizing the GAN objective, we derive a novel and low-variance objective using the discriminator’s output that follows corresponds to the log-likelihood. Compared with the original, the new objective is proved to be consistent in theory and beneficial in practice. The experimental results on various discrete datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Mountain Dew beats Uber in the race for the best and most desired headlines.

We present a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning (i.e. state estimation and system identification) in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. We place a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, resulting in a flexible model able to capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efficient inference, we marginalize over the transition dynamics function and infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using specially tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution can be formulated analytically. Our approach preserves the full nonparametric expressivity of the model and can make use of sparse Gaussian processes to greatly reduce computational complexity.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here is a part of the article generated by you.<n><n>State-space models successfully used in many areas to model time series and dynamic systems.<n>We present a fully Bayesian solution to inference and learning <n>to capture complex dynamical phenomena in nonlinear nonlinear nonparametricstate-space models.<n>We place a Gaussian process before the state transition dynamics, which results in a flexible model able  to capture complex dynamical processes.<n>Once a sample from the smoothed distribution is computed, thestate transition predictive distribution can be formed Analytically.

Previous research mainly focuses on producing a colored image to match the original one. However, since many colors share the same gray value, an input grayscale image could be diversely colored while maintaining its reality. In this paper, we design a novel solution for unsupervised diverse colorization. Specifically, we leverage conditional generative adversarial networks to model the distribution of real-world item colors, in which we develop a fully convolutional generator with multi-layer noise to enhance diversity, with multi-layer condition concatenation to maintain reality, and with stride 1 to keep spatial information. With such a novel network architecture, the model yields highly competitive performance on the open LSUN bedroom dataset. The Turing test of 80 humans further indicates our generated color schemes are highly convincible.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The LSUN bedroom dataset contains unsupervised, unmodified (uncolored) images of human subjects.

However, designing studies around the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology POR criteria can be methodologically challenging, as the new definition includes various POR subpopulations with diverse baseline characteristics and unknown clinical prognosis. When designing RCTs, potential result bias may be introduced if women from each subpopulation are not evenly allocated between intervention groups. In the case of small or moderate-size RCTs, a single-sequence randomization method may not ensure balanced allocation between groups. Stratified randomization methods provide an alternative methodological approach. Depending on the chosen methodology, patient characteristics and outcomes within each intervention group may be better reported according to relevant subpopulations.<n><n>### Response:<n>		I propose to create a template for new research in the field of assisted conception.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Given an abstract of a paper, generate a title for this paper such that conveys the key focus of the paper.<n><n>### Input:<n>Abstract: Five children, aged 6 to 16 years, were tested for unilateral discrimination and interhemispheric transfer of tactile information as well as tactuomotor learning at various intervals before and after therapeutic callosotomy. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative capacities revealed that younger children are considerably less affected by the interruption of callosal transmission than older children. Bilateral organization of speech and participation of the anterior commissure can largely be excluded as possible compensatory mechanisms. The most plausible explanation for the excellent preservation of interhemispheric integration of tactile functions in the younger patients appears to be continued reliance on ipsilateral pathways. The relatively greater deficits observed in the older children, on the other hand, suggest that sensorimotor functions come to depend more extensively on contralateral pathways as the corpus callosum reaches functional maturity.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Surgery, after supportive callosotomy, discovered that younger children are considerably lesser affected by the interruption of  callosal transmission than older kids.

Its opponents have pointed to an infinite series of cases where the existence of one small Godel could produce an infinite number of outcomes, for example, a mosquito buzzing against a buzzing mosquito. Godel's theorem states that such a case is not possible, but there are at least a couple of interesting solutions that are solvable under certain conditions. <n><n>The first proposal is to use a purely formal method, the theorem of the integration theorem, to solve the problem. First, consider the case of infinitely many closed orbits. If a self-moving object approaches a circular mass M closer and closer M, we will have an infinitely many different outcomes. <n><n>Subsequent to the integration theorem, a number of counter-intuitive results were suggested by Gerard 't Hooft. For example, if M is a closed system, the Hamiltonian interpretation of the theorem that Godel's incompatibility theorem should apply does not hold. Further, the idea of an infinite number of outcomes seems absurd.<n><n>The final proposal is to use a more general theorem known as the Barth theorem. In Barth's version of the theorem you can solve the problem of Godel's

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We propose a simple, scalable, fully generative model for transition-based dependency parsing with high accuracy. The model, parameterized by Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Processes, overcomes the limitations of previous generative models by allowing fast and accurate inference. We propose an efficient decoding algorithm based on particle filtering that can adapt the beam size to the uncertainty in the model while jointly predicting POS tags and parse trees. The UAS of the parser is on par with that of a greedy discriminative baseline. As a language model, it obtains better perplexity than a n-gram model by performing semi-supervised learning over a large unlabelled corpus. We show that the model is able to generate locally and syntactically coherent sentences, opening the door to further applications in language generation.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The goal of this task is to generate a headline (Title) for the text provided.

While finite-horizon DECPOMDPs have enjoyed significant success, progress remains slow for the infinite-horizon case mainly due to the inherent complexity of optimizing stochastic controllers representing agent policies. We present a promising new class of algorithms for the infinite-horizon case, which recasts the optimization problem as inference in a mixture of DBNs. An attractive feature of this approach is the straightforward adoption of existing inference techniques in DBNs for solving DEC-POMDPs and supporting richer representations such as factored or continuous states and actions. We also derive the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to optimize the joint policy represented as DBNs. Experiments on benchmark domains show that EM compares favorably against the state-of-the-art solvers.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The goal of this task is to generate a headline (title) for the text provided.

Unfortunately, researchers working in this paradigm have re­ stricted much of their attention to rather sim­ ple representations of belief states, namely logically closed sets of propositional sen­ tences. In our opinion, this has resulted in a too abstract categorisation of belief change operations: expansion, revision, or contrac­ tion. Occasionally, in the AGM paradigm, also probabilistic belief changes have been considered, and it is widely accepted that the probabilistic version of expansion is con­ ditioning. However, we argue that it may be more correct to view conditioning and expan­ sion as two essentially different kinds of belief change, and that what we call constraining is a better candidate for being considered prob­ abilistic expansion.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The idea of AGM has been used by researchers working in the paradigm of belief re-volution. However, it has been propor tioned that this paradigm has resulted in a too con-trocenta n line of thought to be able to categorise belief change operations in such a way that they could con-trocentate their work.

An initial dose of 0.6 mg kg-1 provided excellent intubating conditions in all patients. Subsequent neuromuscular blockade was monitored with a peripheral nerve stimulator and incremental doses of atracurium were given on reappearance of a single twitch. Neuromuscular conduction was allowed to return at the end of surgery and by careful timing of increments it was necessary to antagonize the neuromuscular blockade in only two patients.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Hepatic dysfunction caused by biliac heart disease resulted in numerous complications, which required intensive care. To maximize the chances of survival, the baby's parents were advised to keep a low level of alcohol available throughout the operation. A subsequent study found that the combination of atracurium, a protein that helps the liver absorb nutrients and oxygen, and neuromuscular blockers was sufficient to treat the problem.

It has no natural light, so it reflects a great deal of heat that occurs during the production process of baking. On top of that, it is incredibly expensive:<n><n>-  It would take 3.6 million piños (3,000,000,000, pounds) to make one ounce of pewter. That's because all of the copper used in the production process is in extremely fine grained bronze, and it takes nearly three times as much copper now to make one ounce of pure pewter. (To put it into perspective: take a teaspoon of powdered gold and put it into a blender, and you will get pewter.)<n>- Pour half of it into a vase and add a third of hot water to fully convert the water into steam. When the steam climbs to a cinder, it becomes a liquid and becomes hard as a rock. Pewter has a cracking tendency that makes the surface of the bar slightly irregular. This is why pewter is considered to be expensive:<n><n>- A pewter bar will take up to half an hour

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We tackle the problem of inferring node labels in a partially labeled graph where each node in the graph has multiple label types and each label type has a large number of possible labels. Our primary example, and the focus of this paper, is the joint inference of label types such as hometown, current city, and employers, for users connected by a social network. Standard label propagation fails to consider the properties of the label types and the interactions between them. Our proposed method, called EDGEEXPLAIN, explicitly models these, while still enabling scalable inference under a distributed message-passing architecture. On a billion-node subset of the Facebook social network, EDGEEXPLAIN significantly outperforms label propagation for several label types, with lifts of up to 120% for recall@1 and 60% for recall@3.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We create headlines for the following text using the joint inference of label type such as hometown, current location, and employers.

Twenty-five patients were anaesthetized with halothane at least 10 times in a year. No patient developed postoperative jaundice. Sixty-nine children were exposed to two halothane anaesthetics within 28 days on 149 occasions and serial estimations of serum liver enzyme concentrations were obtained. Minor increases in the concentrations of serum AST and ALT were recorded in 10.6% and 4.7% of patient entries, respectively. Postoperative GGT and SAP concentrations were increased in 2.7% of patient entries. Patients in whom enzyme values were increased before the first anaesthetic were no more likely than other subjects to develop further changes.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The title of this paper is "HALOHANE: The Year Without a Hero".

This problem may be even worse for postgraduate students who are new to a field and may not know where to start. To address this problem, we have developed an online catalog of research papers where the papers have been automatically categorized by a topic model. The catalog contains 7719 papers from the proceedings of two artificial intelligence conferences from 2000 to 2015. Rather than the commonly used Latent Dirichlet Allocation, we use a recently proposed method called hierarchical latent tree analysis for topic modeling. The resulting topic model contains a hierarchy of topics so that users can browse the topics from the top level to the bottom level. The topic model contains a manageable number of general topics at the top level and allows thousands of fine-grained topics at the bottom level. It also can detect topics that have emerged recently.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Hierarchy of topics allows thousands of fine- grained topics at the bottom layer.

We have assessed HPRT mutants in peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with connective tissue diseases who have been treated for long periods with cytotoxic drugs. The results from patients treated with cyclophosphamide were abnormal suggesting the presence of drug-induced mutations. The results from patients treated with chlorambucil or azathioprine did not differ from controls--either these drugs have not induced mutations or, more likely, the technique is not sufficiently sensitive to detect them. These possibilities are discussed. Specific mutations induced by cytotoxic drugs in patients with connective tissue diseases have not been previously recorded.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The title of this paper is "Transforming cells with mutations at the hypoxic-guanine-phosphoribosyl transferrase (HPRT) location may be detected in vitro with the resistance to thioguanine toxicity."

The type II prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas adaptive immune system has been shown to facilitate RNA-guided site-specific DNA cleavage. We engineered two different type II CRISPR/Cas systems and demonstrate that Cas9 nucleases can be directed by short RNAs to induce precise cleavage at endogenous genomic loci in human and mouse cells. Cas9 can also be converted into a nicking enzyme to facilitate homology-directed repair with minimal mutagenic activity. Lastly, multiple guide sequences can be encoded into a single CRISPR array to enable simultaneous editing of several sites within the mammalian genome, demonstrating easy programmability and wide applicability of the RNA-guided nuclease technology.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The functional elucidation of causal genetic variant and elements requires precise genome Editing technologies.

However, so far no drug against HIV-1 infection exhibiting this mechanism of action has been approved. To identify new potent candidates for inhibitors, we performed in silico screening of a commercial database of more than 1,300 drug-like compounds by using receptorbased docking studies. The candidates selected from docking studies were subsequently tested using biological assays to assess anti-HIV activities. As a result, two compounds were identified as the most active. Specifically, both exhibited anti-HIV activity against viral replication at a low concentration and relatively low cytotoxicity at the effective concentration inhibiting viral growth by 50 %.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Cyclophilic acid (Cyclophilin) has attracted attention recently as it is a new target of antihuman immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV1) drugs.

Preferred titles are under thirty words.<n><n>### Input:<n>Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In obese individuals, adipose tissue releases increased amounts of non-esterified fatty acids, glycerol, hormones, pro-inflammatory cytokines and other factors that are involved in the development of insulin resistance. When insulin resistance is accompanied by dysfunction of pancreatic islet β-cells — the cells that release insulin — failure to control blood glucose levels results. Abnormalities in β-cell function are therefore critical in defining the risk and development of type 2 diabetes. This knowledge is fostering exploration of the molecular and genetic basis of the disease and new approaches to its treatment and prevention.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The goal of this task is to generate a title for this article.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>In the fashion industry, order scheduling focuses on the assignment of production orders to appropriate production lines. In reality, before a new order can be put into production, a series of activities known as pre-production events need to be completed. In addition, in real production process, owing to various uncertainties, the daily production quantity of each order is not always as expected. In this research, by considering the pre-production events and the uncertainties in the daily production quantity, robust order scheduling problems in the fashion industry are investigated with the aid of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) called nondominated sorting adaptive differential evolution (NSJADE). The experimental results illustrate that it is of paramount importance to consider pre-production events in order scheduling problems in the fashion industry. We also unveil that the existence of the uncertainties in the daily production quantity heavily affects the order scheduling.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In this task you are given a part (Article) of an article. Your goal is to generate a headline (Title) for this text.

We were unable to show any abnormality in the excretion of Zn, Mg or GAG. In 11 patients, a low level of urinary citrate was a significant feature that was associated in most cases with a urinary pH value above 6. Citrate concentration (per litre) and output (per 24 h) were found to be lower than in the controls in 19 and 33% respectively of the determinations. The overall ratio of average urinary citrate concentration in patients and controls was 0.56, a figure in agreement with previous data.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The excretion of four inhibitors Of urinary stone formation was studied in 20 normal control and 40 recurrent calcium stone formationers who were placed on the fixed diet restricted in calcium
