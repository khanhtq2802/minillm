The key to making a good apple muffin is to use apples that are fresh, rather than ones that are frozen. To make this recipe, you will need: a good quality apple, a pastry cutter, a wooden spoon, and a bit of patience. First, prepare the apple by chopping it into cubes. Next, cut the apple into thin slices. You will then need to use the pastry cutter to cut the slices. This will ensure that the apples are evenly distributed throughout the muffin. Once the apple slices are cut, you will then need to arrange them on top of each other. This will ensure that each apple has a fair amount of juice. Finally, bake the apple muffin in the oven at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes. Once the muffin is fully cooked, you will remove it from the oven and enjoy it with a glass of wine.

The tool uses a set of rules to detect conflicts between GitHub pull requests, and when a conflict occurs, it automatically merges the changes from both sources. For example, if a pull request contains changes that are either duplicates of previous commits or changes that are not relevant to the original project, the tool will automatically merge the changes from the original source and report the conflict to the users.<n><n>Most Git commands require a user interaction, such as clicking on a pull request or selecting a file to merge. For example, the Git command to merge a GitHub pull request with a Git commit requires a user interaction. To resolve conflicts between pull requests and Git commits, use the GitHub conflict resolution tool to identify conflicts and report them to the users.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Answer the question about the paper after reading it carefully.<n><n>### Input:<n>To evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes.<n>Question: What is English constituency parsing?<n><n>### Response:<n>		English constituency parsing is a type of machine learning task that is typically applied to words in English.  The goal of the English constituency parsing task is to generate a sequence of output words that are both lexically and syntactically similar to the current word, but differ in syntactic structure.  The output words are represented as a set of binary trees, where each node is a word that is either a constituent of a word in the input or a different word from the current word.  The goal of this task is to find words that are both lexical and syntactically similar, but different in structure.  For example, if the input word is "tree", the output word is "tree".  If the input word is "row", the output word is either "row" or "tree".  These words are associated with different classes of words.  Examples of different classes of words include "word", "verb", "adverb", "noun", and "noun".  The test model used in this task is a two-layer model, with the input word being a word and the output word being a sequence of words.  The sequence of words is typically a single word, but can include words that are embedded within a word.

It spans from the colonial era to the modern era.  There are many reasons why people care about the US history.  One reason is that the US was founded by slaves.  Another reason is that the US is a constitutional republic, which means that the US has the power to set the rules of federal law.  The US also has a great history of racial segregation.  In the early days, people were forced to use the word "nigger" to refer to each other.  During the Civil War, people fought for the Union, and the country was split between North and South.  After the Civil War, the US was divided between the states, and the Civil Rights movement helped to change the politics of the country.  The US has a long history of public health and education.  The US has one of the highest rates of childhood obesity.  Additionally, the US has a strong agricultural industry, and many people rely on manufacturing for their livelihood.
