Strong partnerships attain global influence and drive funding, longevity, and profitability. These collaborations often include corporate employees working on broader data science, machine learning, and analyst workflows to bring together individual researchers and technical teams.

Your help is needed in automating code generation to speed up the development process.<n><n>### Input:<n>python function to determine whether a number is prime.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Good! We need to bring in a C library that provides this functionality.<n><n>Files related to numerical computing are divided into maintanence-programming subsets (e.g., calculus, linear algebra, signal processing, and statistics). Because this is a numeric computation, functions are called primes. Usually one finds the number prime by looking up the number in a book or a scientific journal, but in simple cases it may become apparent at a glance by observing the numbers grouped by regions of interest like arms, legs, head.<n><n>To determine whether a number is a prime, we first need to determine its symmetry symmetry. Other terms included here may provide more specific answers, e.g., the Chandrasekharan–Blaschko theorem in linear algebra. But here we can narrow down a single definition of a prime to a specific symmetry — a number with at most one symmetry.<n><n>When we're successful in proving a number is prime, we can return to the contents of the number book or journal to further inspect its symmetry. Because many of our functionality updates involve solving more advanced problems than those with simple examples, we must spend more time solving solutions that are simple and easy.<n><n>A prime number (not counting the number itself)

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What are the steps to using random (yet coherent) text as filler content within your Word document?<n><n>### Response:<n>		There are several techniques which help generate random text within your Word document. Typically the most popular is noting down your text and locating an appropriate word or phrase to fill in those missing spaces in your text. For example, you can create a text document that includes a paragraph of text and then draw a randomly generated image of the paragraph or a random image of the keyword under consideration within the paragraph. Additionally, it is best to create multiple Word documents containing similar text and to highlight "true" words/phrases. For example, you may notice that every time you are attempting to fill in a blank space within your text you are actually filling in the blank. This can be aesthetically pleasing, as it will appear like all the text within has been removed from the document.

By pairing this warm color palette with equally-warm, light-colored overlays, your audience will naturally enjoy everything about your presentation, no matter how mundane the details may look at a glance or particularly pleasing to behold.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Please suggest a few papers to consider based on the search term given. The names of the papers should be listed.<n><n>### Input:<n>Topic: scaling law + machine learning<n><n>### Response:<n>		Large-scale machine learning models have been used to predict outcomes in fields such as insurance, stock market, weather, and epidemiology. There are numerous applications that span multiple fields, such as finance, healthcare, and even finance. Detecting anomalous outcomes from model training approaches requires more than just training sets and data. Software must be developed to correctly model interactions among the various policies underlying machine learning. This can result in issues when trying to explain such machine learning to business and users. Scaling law and machine learning—with both the scientific and legal frameworks—are particularly useful when governments attempt to comply with legal obligations, such as medical device liability insurance. Governmental cooperation with business, industry, and consumers seems an appropriate use of machine learning, and now is a powerful tool for understanding the law, both at the corporate and state level.

Then throw it in a pan and heat it to a gentle boil. Combine it with the other ingredients and mix it well together. Then when it starts boiling, remove it from the heat and give it gentle stir. A short time later, when it's no longer boiling, turn the heat back to medium and gradually warm it again.<n><n>Once it reaches a gentle boil, lower it by 1cm (= the diameter of an apple) down to a simmer and let it simmer gently for 30 minutes. With the muffin tester and mixer on low, slowly pour it into the prepared apple muffin tin. Use the spatula to press down the mixture onto a surface, and peel down the mound, which should appear ~10cm (~3/4 inch) thick. For higher volume, permit it to sit for 10-15 minutes longer.<n><n>After 30 minutes, turn the heat to medium and stir the apple mixture. This should not cause a browned layer, but

Motivation and rewards are driven by entertaining information in the form of eye candy — or actual feelings of accomplishment and pleasure. Shifting focus and mindset can reverse this. It is time to call out the practitioners of the "insanity" workout culture.

It still means the same thing today. An analogy drawn from medieval Germany is that of a crossbar in a bar. Bad traders would prepare unforeseen favors, receiving a "crossbar" in return.

It should send a "hearsay" version of the presentation so that the audience can review it, should include set names and other technical notes, and should be sent on a USB thumb drive.<n><n>The purpose of an email message is to establish trust.

Given that, it is good to consider a "hearsay," which often contain the same informational, or at least identical, as the presented slides when processing the confirmation email.<n><n>Trouble always occurs when material that is newly received contradicts established pre-existing practices. When preparing the email for the meeting, information is often mixed shortly before the time schedule or before the envelope arrives.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Write a step-by-step guide for resolving GitHub merge conflicts.<n><n>### Response:<n>		First, you need to determine if your issue is related to improper behavior of the merge operation or merge host. If yes, you can edit the bug report to include the issue ID number, the date of the issue, and any comments that may have been added by the merge host. Review any pull requests that the merge host may have seeded upstream, and if necessary, include pull request formatting in the bug report. Additionally, review the bug report for comments that may have been made by the merge host itself. Uncover emergent behavior that is leading to the host dropping its merge request or alerting the developer to the issue (if there is one). Pull requests see in this space editor-only due to the high volume of pull requests. The best place to find new bugs may follow an automated system called trac. If the bug fix does not directly affect merge operations or host behavior, the issue is likely to be of high priority, have high visibility, have been very under-resourced, and simply does not exist. If, on the other hand, the algorithm used in the bug fix actually causes merge conflicts, we should not focus on alternative proposals that may be more relevant and merge host behavior may evolve before we dive into this important issue.

The lifestyle, the  substance and the amount of money — they all use their talents, properties and connections beyond their means to achieve their goals. This is not in Suicide Island, where money and success are primarily the index finger on the extended hand.  They are all on their own making ends meet, without the help or guidance of a circle of backers or friends.  The occasionally cool scenes of Spiro charging a selfie stick, wasting cash on George Takei's beauty pageants, and swaying with Janet Jones when she is emotionally resolved see less influence on the camera and their use appears more desperate.<n><n>DFS also deviates from its aggressive pacing, its portrayal of drugs and violence, its HTC-4 tag team in relation to the protagonist's growth as a high schooler, its subtle and bittersweet chat with Spiro about divorce, Velvet Underground songs and bedroom activities, and its benevolent father-son dynamic. Given its high production values, FTV is also a must watch, but its

Its streets and straight streets form a veritable fairytale; a fusion of classical, European and indigenous styles, each prominent, distinctive building featuring a cafe and antique shop, a pizzeria, a wine bar, an ice cream bar, as well as castles, towns and other buildings that are often diverse in layout and purpose.<n>The city center is largely empty at nighttime, yet still provides easy access by airport transfer, three Francia metro lines, and a few Bus Rapid Transit lines. Its extensive network of lifts allowed the citizens of Spain's famous coastal areas, particularly, Canary Islands and Andalus, to enjoy rides on the local famous Ferrolen Galax M train.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Answer the following question.<n><n>### Input:<n>How do I compare strings in Java?<n>I've been using the == operator in my program to compare all my strings so far. However, I ran into a bug, changed one of them into.equals() instead, and it fixed the bug.<n>Is == bad? When should it and should it not be used? What's the difference?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Not really, it's pretty much the same thing. Use == as you would use any other method. Don't change patterns or use a == in a comparison method if the methods involved aren't the same as string comparisons.

The task is to evaluate each answer and determine if it is correct. If incorrect, explain why.<n><n>### Input:<n>Is there a way of reading one single character from the user input? For instance, they press one key at the terminal and it is returned (sort of like getch()). I know there's a function in Windows for it, but I'd like something that is cross-platform.<n>Answer 1: Here's a link to the ActiveState Recipes site that says how you can read a single character in Windows, Linux and OSX :<n>https://code.activestate.com/recipes/134892/<n>Answer 2: if you just want to hold the screen so you can see the result on the terminal just write `input()` at the end of the code and it will hold the screen<n><n>### Response:<n>		Yes, you can read one single character from the input by writing the code above. Assuming the person who typed it had the Win32 API key, this would work out because when running the code, the output will be a single character at a time.

Use some examples and constraints to improve your question.<n><n>### Input:<n>Dynamic Programming<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here is an example of a programming problem that can be used as a starting point for a Design:<n>Random numbers are commonly problems. In many programming languages, a common programming pattern to solve such problems is to use a deterministic programming algorithm designed to find an optimal algorithm by testing its predictions. In particular, this is what is done by a recursive algorithm which is meant to find the best algorithm single-threaded by a single iteration. Examples of deterministic programming algorithms include biggs, polymath.cs, and bgcl which can use the ideas from linear programming and random number generation to solve most problems in the data science community. The main idea is to select a feasible algorithm which is open to further iterations but this algorithm needs to be re-implemented by a scalable implementation. Typical algorithm development happens on stochastic arrays versus linear linear programming time series so the choice of a small implementation that is fast to train is a smart one. In this respect recursive algorithms can have very challenging design, as they need to worry about slow inputs that cannot be predicted. Therefore, there exists a need to design an algorithm that can produce at a scale efficient guarantees of correctness. In this regard, there is a growing literature on Disneyland algorithm, most notably seen in Design

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>You will need to guide this person through the scenario they have described for the interview.<n><n>### Input:<n>Finally! After a while of shooting in the dark and frantically fiddling with sample inputs on the whiteboard, you've came up with an algorithm for solving the coding question your interviewer gave you.<n>Whew. Such a relief to have a clear path forward. To not be flailing anymore.<n>Now you're cruising, getting ready to code up your solution.<n>When suddenly, your interviewer throws you a curve ball.<n>"What if we thought of the problem this way?"<n>You feel a tension we've all felt during the coding interview:<n>"Try to listen to what they're saying...but don't lose your train of thought...ugh, I can't do both!"<n><n>### Response:<n>		The tension in your chest is what caused you to lose your train of thought. The question was right on your head, but you were too busy glancing at the whiteboard and trying to figure out how to translate the text onto a programming language.<n><n>So you keep trying to find the right answer without actually understanding the text. In order to avoid falling into the trap of blindly following your instincts, you re-arrange your thinking.<n><n>You start with a doubt:<n>"What if there's really only an algorithm for solving this problem?"<n>There is no algorithm for solving this problem, so it's easy to fall into the same trap again. Start your search by asking yourself if the question actually needs to be 'DO SOMETHING WRONG' by changing the meaning here.<n>The problem itself is already tricky enough; changing the wording is no different from changing the problem structure. Conversely, it's often very easy to fall into the trap of instantly following instructions when the question you are trying to debug asks for a solution that is 'do something wrong'.<n><n>To avoid this, you can try wrapping your head around the coding process once more. Think through the possible options. Consider both the structure of the question and potential solutions. Pick the simplest

Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The "Fair Trade" movement has promoted the use of labour, social and environmental standards and criteria in the production of commodities. These ideas have also been dubbed as trade justice. The movement claims that trading while respecting these principles is still morally okay while businesses that do not comply face legal consequences.  The debate has ignited a debate on whether trade is still morally okay while business that fails to comply will face legal consequences.  Without the detailed background of the topic, this brief overview should guide you, and help highlight similarities between the debate and classic capitalist theories.

Take your knife and carefully peel off the peanuts with short slicing motions, while staying far away from the chocolate so as not to damage the chocolate. Once you have fully peeled the peanuts, place them into another bowl on the plate opposite of the chocolate. The chocolate will likely not migrate completely throughout this step, so be patient.<n>5. Next, ask the curious onlookers to check the integrity of the chocolate with a small increase of pressure, and without moving the chocolate. If the  and finished result looks too good to be true, do a re-heating test.<n>6.

Would you like to see some options?<n>Customer: Yeah, that would be great.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here are two phone types that might work for you. That information, along with what phone as a starting point, can help you narrow down the options. In either case, I recommend you try the following:<n>1) Check out a couple of popular phones, preferably ones with better cameras. These usually come down to battery life and accuracy. If you can live without either, then by all means, go for it. Good luck!<n>2) Ask friends and family if they have any iPhones for sale. If you are interested, invite them over. These offers tend to be well-received.<n>A final but important step is to evaluate pricing, and if you are outside of the US,  international options can be a good first step. For instance, look for international resellers in Europe or the Middle East that may have local versions you can try. If that doesn't work, try overseas retailers  such as Amazon and Amazon Prime,  as their sales staff can usually reach a much larger number of buyers ; if not, re-use online a list of UK and German website listings  that match your ideal needs. If you find that the phone is not quite right, or that you are still not sure what you want, then contact the seller directly to
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Describe the content of the article in a brief manner.<n><n>### Input:<n>A study published earlier this year by Zee and her team examined the role of light in sleep for healthy adults in their 20s. Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The authors of the study, Zee and her colleagues, detailed their effects on healthy adults in their 20's by waking them up in the middle of the night with a dim light. The participants remained asleep for 30 minutes afterward; the researchers returned for the younger participants who had never been exposed to the light at the start: the latter group chose to spend the night with their parents. Some of the participants in the later age groups were below the 20s, but the magnitude of the effects was similar: the more susceptible participants were to adverse events. The study was published in the Archives of Internal Medicine.

The machine-learning model is called a neural network and the objective is to maximize the frequency of words that match the pattern, say by minimizing the average number of words per word.<n><n>The problem is that words are frequently misspelled since there is not a standard way to indicate which words should be included and which should be excluded. Most currently available devices typically show the labeled words as they appear in the text and do not provide a way to evaluate which words should not be included in the set or which words should be included in the set. Most often, these devices put words either directly into the text or show the spelling of words in associated text but do not allow for the recognition of missing words (for example, by generating sentences without the necessary context or highlighting words that are absent).<n><n>This leaves the user with either mislabeled words or sentences where-as claimed words may in fact be correct (the machine-learning model over-predicts words by 20%, even when there is no requirement to record the exact score). The computational model needs to collect data on the labeled text, the surrounding text, the text in the

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>List the concepts that should be learned before approaching the given complex concept.<n><n>### Input:<n>Deep Learning<n><n>### Response:<n>		Deep Learning  is a field of study that deals with using data and algorithms to build more complex models. Here are some concepts that users should be familiar with in order to properly tackle the task at hand:<n>1. Dimensions: for learners, there are concepts that help drive the model by measuring parameter values to model the behavior of the model.<n>2. Network Basics - here, you'll likely find some discussions around the existence of a connection between networks. Similar to dimensions, network concepts can also drive the model by measuring the strength of connections. So instead of digging deep to understand some fancy new concept, you should already be familiar with some core concepts so you don't have to dive too deep. Here are some network concepts you may learn from:<n>3. Features vs. Objects : unlike dimensions, network concepts can be used to see similarities. Hence, you can more easily compare models, not just similarities.<n>4. Training vs. Observing Data and Networks : features vs. networks refers to the topic of object vs. feature comparisons. There are essentially four tools available to you. Eve and R, for example, can be trained on huge amounts of data and data which if compared can tell you things about aggregates. <n>5. Detection vs.

Try to explain the movie in just one sentence.<n><n>### Input:<n>The Shining<n><n>### Response:<n>		The Shining, also known as the TV show and movie "The Exorcist", was a British horror movie that aired on the television network ITV. The point of the show was to scare children. It became popular worldwide, with most countries including the UK and United States being included in the syndication for multiple seasons, until it was canceled in 2007 via HBO after 115 episodes. The young filmmaker found a sympathetic audience through genre fiction, with Stephen King's The Stand being his first anti-horror movie made. The movie follows a family (Alex, the eldest of the family) as they cope with their mother's terminal illness and attempts to get through the negligent disposal of her deceased husband's remains. Along the way, they uncover a disconcerting amount of information about the local children. Children learn about possession, supernatural activity, hauntings, even dreams. The film further provides a glimpse into Alex's relationship with his brother, Michael, and how he responds to their father's deteriorating mental state. In the end, they learn the truth about death after all, even the arrangement that brought them home.

Audit your costs with a service provider. Most enterprises will provide some form of expense tracking to track your costs. 2. Set aside a sufficiently small budget for some time. 300 days and 1 month are a good start. 3. Identify the questions you’re most comfortable answering and general practice questions you want to take on. 4. Prioritize your onboarding with lower priority, challenging, and general questions as opposed to more expert and high impact ones. Good luck!<n><n>Thanks for your time.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Make a list of the pros and cons of the given decision.<n><n>### Input:<n>Implementing a Remote Working Policy<n><n>### Response:<n>		Remote working is a way to achieve faster iteration times for your code, more participants, and also more scalable architectures, all with remote infrastructure. However, there are pros and cons to this approach. Pros include faster iteration times, but not everyone will enjoy this, at least for the foundational libraries. At the same time, the pros also benefit from reduced setup costs, both on-premises and cloud providers. The con is that the complexity of distilling work from remote work to locally hosted software combined with lack of consistency in terms of the deployment of the software is not always the easiest to manage, either on-premises or in the cloud.

Regularly cut away between 15-20 minutes of minimal exercise time and rest as much as possible during these breaks. Some examples of exercises that can be beneficial to mental focus include pushups, pullups, high-kipping dolphin presses, beat pushups, dolphin presses, and sit ups. Also avoid activities that rely for much energy such as: drum circles, pushups, dog, tennis court, pushups, drag races, friction exercises, sweaty yoga. Avoid these activities when in an office environment as you will burn more calories. For the latter example, do not muscle up during your workplace workout as there is a chance of injuring yourself. In the office, performing such exercises can enhance both your mental and physical fitness.
