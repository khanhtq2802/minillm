It's meant to compare strings in Java by checking if they contain the same string literal, and if so, to compare them side-by-side.<n>However, when I tried using == in my code, it fixed a bug that was present in previous versions of Java, so I wouldn't be using == anymore. Instead, I'd recommend using == instead of comparing because the type inference of == checks for the same type, and can be more efficient.
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>You are given a question and two possible answers. The task is to evaluate each answer and determine if it is correct. If incorrect, explain why.<n><n>### Input:<n>Is there a way of reading one single character from the user input? For instance, they press one key at the terminal and it is returned (sort of like getch()). I know there's a function in Windows for it, but I'd like something that is cross-platform.<n>Answer 1: Here's a link to the ActiveState Recipes site that says how you can read a single character in Windows, Linux and OSX :<n>https://code.activestate.com/recipes/134892/<n>Answer 2: if you just want to hold the screen so you can see the result on the terminal just write `input()` at the end of the code and it will hold the screen<n><n>### Response:<n>		Yes. The function that you use to read one single character in Windows, Unix and OSX is called getch(). It accepts a string as an argument and returns the character that was pressed. It's cross-platform and can be used from multiple platforms.

After a while of shooting in the dark and frantically fiddling with sample inputs on the whiteboard, you've came up with an algorithm for solving the coding question your interviewer gave you.<n>Whew. Such a relief to have a clear path forward. To not be flailing anymore.<n>Now you're cruising, getting ready to code up your solution.<n>When suddenly, your interviewer throws you a curve ball.<n>"What if we thought of the problem this way?"<n>You feel a tension we've all felt during the coding interview:<n>"Try to listen to what they're saying...but don't lose your train of thought...ugh, I can't do both!"<n><n>### Response:<n>		That is a great point. Try to follow the flow of the interview and let your brain process the information coming from your manager. Keep your questions clear and concise, but also don't get too caught up in the details. It's okay to ask clarifying questions so that your interviewer understands where you need to go with the coding, but don't get too hung up on the solution or go over the top with it. The goal is to get the interviewee to go off script and write the solution down.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Improve the article using your knowledge of the topic in order to make it more informative.<n><n>### Input:<n>The "fair trade" movement, also known as the "trade justice" movement, promotes the use of labour, environmental and social standards for the production of commodities, particularly those exported from the Third and Second Worlds to the First World. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The "Fair Trade" movement, also knownas the "trade justice" Movement, promotes the use of Labour, environmental and social standards of the production of commodities,particularly those exported from the Third World to the First World. Common standards advocate for minimum wages, social and health benefits, fair working conditions, and the right to use materials produced within the context of "fair trade" practices. Futures contracts, in contrast to tariffs, serve as a form of protected international trade, in contrast to tariffs which restrict, by law, a country's ability to protect its domestic industry. New Zealand has been a leader in the globalisation of services, particularly of financial services, and has benefited from the internationalisation of services over many decades. This has contributed significantly to the construction of a globalisation economy based on the use of both inward and outward migration. Futures contracts, while less efficient than tariffs, provide a significant alternative to the regulation of raw materials, services and capital goods. As a result, the UK has been a strong advocate for changes to trade law, with its recent commitment to the "transition to trade" of services.

Music performances became increasingly visual with the broadcast and recording of performances.<n>20th-century music brought new freedom and wide experimentation with new musical styles and forms that challenged the accepted rules of music of earlier periods. The invention of musical amplification and electronic instruments, especially the synthesizer, in the mid-20th century revolutionized classical and popular music, and accelerated the development of new forms of music.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The quality of the writing is subpar. Although the author explains that new music was being recorded and played on the radio, the article does not go into sufficient detail to understand the current state of the art. Furthermore, the author only describes the musical styles of the previous two centuries and does not go into the advances made by the 20th century musicians.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Give students tips on how to keep their nerves under control during class presentations.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Make sure your presentation is appropriately prepared. Check the following tips: <n>First, make sure to properly prepare for the instructor during your break. During your break, do research on topics that you are presenting on. For example, do a little research on why certain types of fear might be relevant in your audience. Once you have that covered, bring up one or two of the examples you use in your presentation to make your point. No matter how well-prepared you are, make sure you sound confident and your audience feels invested in what you are presenting.<n><n>Next, take a few minutes to clear your mind and focus on your voice. Most people have a tendency to over-pronounce their words. Practice makes perfect. When you speak, you should draw your breath as you speak, and your body should naturally follow your words. If you need to pause or speak during your presentation, do so with intent.<n><n>Lastly, speak slowly and confidently. Large groups of people can benefit from taking a break during their presentations to catch their breath. Staying composed throughout your presentation will help keep your nerves under control and provide a more professional presentation.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Develop a mental exercise that can help people manage their anxiety and explain how it works.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In her book "Getting Things Done" Gretchen Rubin explains how anxiety works by showing that people with high anxiety levels tend to have trouble getting things done. For example, "For every 10 people with high anxiety, only 6 get things done, on average." The most effective way to work with your anxiety, she explains, is to find a task that you are actually good at and avoid the task that you are most afraid of. For example, instead of thinking about a difficult task at work where you are very nervous every time you start, find a way to delegate that task to someone else. Many other tasks will not be as difficult for you, so you should not be afraid to delegate them when you start to build a sense of accomplishment. Finally, treating your anxiety with substances like Prozac can help relieve it, too. While there are no scientifically proven substances that can actually help with managing your anxiety, using certain substances when you have high levels of it can significantly help.

The goal of this solvable puzzle is to reach the island within 9 minutes, using only water that has been collected from all available sources.<n><n>To reach the island, you will need to collect water from four different sources: a large lake, three smaller lakes, and 2 islands. The land mass of Aomori is approximately 560 ha, and its elevation varies from a low of 4 on the west shore of the lake to a high of 23 on the east shore of the lake. To reach the island, you must hike up the mountain and reach the “Aomoori Bridge” via a narrow trail on your right.<n><n>From there, you can either drive or walk to the island. Hiking is not recommended due to the risk of falling down the mountain.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Come up with an interesting idea for a new movie plot. Your plot should be described with a title and a summary.<n><n>### Response:<n>		There is much we can learn from the ancient past. Through the study of ancient Egyptian mummies and the analysis of DNA, scientists have been able to piece together fragments of a human skeleton from a period many thousands of years ago. These ancient humans lived in Egypt between 550,000 to 750,000 years ago, and likely had many languages. Their remains have been found in tombs throughout Egypt, and help us better understand the human cultures that shaped the modern world. The discovery of the DNA in the mummified remains is exciting, but there are many questions that need answering. Could these ancient DNA sequences be a clue to more ancient human cultures that left no written records? Or is this just another example of modern science being too high tech?

In March 2005, the US District Court for the Southern District of New York issued an order requiring Yahoo to remove Gmail from its servers, after a two-year investigation. The order, which was later modified, specifically targeted three servers used by the service, and three email servers used by third-party email providers.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Notify me of any suggestions you may have for making the text more grammatically correct.<n><n>### Input:<n>This is the second time I've been here, and the vibes, and the food were exquisite.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Thank you so much for coming to the restaurant tonight, it's been amazing. I've been making notes below about how to improve the grammar of the text, especially the last sentence, which needs to be more concise.<n><n>First, I think the proper word for "furniture" is "table." This is because the word is attached to the end of every noun, as in "the furniture she fashioned was beautiful."<n><n>However, there is an article that uses the article "table" in its proper context, so "table" might not be the right word. <n><n>The second suggestion I would make is to use the tense of "were." This is because "were" used in the 3rd person past tense of "were engaging in physical activities."<n><n>There is also an infinitive "were" in the 3rd person present tense of "were talking to each other." An infinitive can indicate "were going away or going in a direction/time"<n><n>Lastly, and most importantly, "were" is spelled out in the body of the text. You can see how it's spelled out below:<n><n>were going away <n>were talking to each other <n>were engaged in physical activities
