Instead of "why", use "there are multiple reasons" or "why now".<n><n>Once you've ensured that all extraneous words from the paragraph are stripped out and any embedded text is dropped completely, you can insert random words (from the list at the top of this article) into the paragraph to make it more fun and interesting.

Word will mark the words as "funny" and insert them automatically in the next paragraph. The "funny" words can still appear in the paragraph if the paragraph is "transparently constructed" (i.e., if you removed the extraneous words and the rest of the text was stripped from it). InsertText function can be used multiple

Great place for breakfast or brunch - and you won't need to eat again for awhile. The restaurant is close to the Tenderloin so be aware of your surroundings.<n>We enjoyed the Succotash Omelet (at least my wife enjoyed it), the Pulled Pork Benedict and the Hangtown Fry. Portions are large and pricing is fair. I wish we could have managed a Beignet Flight!<n>Definitely a spot to seek out. It can be crowed at times so be patient. Well worth any wait.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Hi David,<n><n>I just wanted to send a follow-up review for the Succotash omelet and Pulled Pork Benedict.<n><n>First, we were disappointed in the quality of the Omelet. It was so dry and soft. We're used to ordering a higher quality breakfast or brunch, and was afraid to partake in this because my wife frequently ordered it.<n>Second, the Pulled Pork Benedict was mediocre. The crust was chewy, and the meat was dry. Overall, we would give this a 3.5 star rating, as we're not repeat customers and had no complains.<n>Third, the Succotash was by far the best deal we picked. We've been coming to this restaurant for years, and we've never had a bad experience. Great service, clean place, and friendly people. This is just a perfectly average experience.<n>Fourth, the overall cost of this meal was reasonable. We were only expecting around $15 for the pulled pork. The restaurant was close to a Tenderloin, so my guess is it's relatively inexpensive. We're happy with the food and would highly recommend this spot for future meals.<n><n>Overall, 4 stars gives this spot 4.5 / 5 stars,

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Write a short analysis of the cinematography in the movie.<n><n>### Input:<n>Dead Poets Society<n><n>### Response:<n>		I. cinematography in Dead Poets Society is unequivocally bad. There are so many shots of people being beaten, tased, pushed, pushed into difficult positions etc that would make even a hardened apologist for the movie nervous. It is most likely the director was fed up with this aspect of the movie and wanted to get rid of it later on. II. the acting is atrocious. While most of the characters have great dialogues they speak in generic halting tones and have no effort put into their acting. III. the music is equally atrocious. The opening and closing credits are composed by John Kander, who is known for orchestral compositions, but chose to use a synth-pop soundtrack for the duration of the credits. Further, there is a blatant lack of attention to the acting, with one shot even showing flashes of red blood which is not cool. <n><n>So, while the rest of the movie passes many standards, including being a great documentary on its own, it falls short of being great.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Give a grammar tip on how to end a German verb.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In German, when a verb ends, the sound it makes is German "wendt", where the "w" is the final consonant. You will most likely need to transpose this ending into another form, such as "began", "without", or "at". In usual German, the form of this ending is "diplomat", but in German, it is "formulae". Formulae are used to indicate how a sentence should end, for example "German friend received the ball in the end". When a grammatical tip is followed, everything in the English-language ends in "formulae". Verbose: When a verb is first placed, a warning is attached to it, so that the listener knows you are putting extra stress on it. During a second sentence, when the stress is not present, a grammatical tip is added to the warning. For example "I'm hungry. I have a friend who lives nearby. We should go there together." See German: Formulae for details.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Describe the content of the article in a brief manner.<n><n>### Input:<n>A study published earlier this year by Zee and her team examined the role of light in sleep for healthy adults in their 20s. Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.<n><n>### Response:<n>		A study published by Zee and her colleagues in June 2017 examined the role of light, such as a television set with the sound off,[6][7] in sleep for healthy adults of their 20s. The study found that participants had significantly higher blood sugar and heart rate during the sleep lab experiment when the dim light, such as going to bed with a TV without the sound off, was present. However, the participants in the study experienced a reduced heart rate during the sleep laboratory experiment when the light was elevated (see the inset). This raises the blood sugar and heart rates of the young people during sleep lab experiment 1, which the scientists believe may have contributed to the development of diabetes and early death.<n><n>The researchers suspect that raising the heart rate of the young participants during sleep lab 1 may have caused a change in glucose metabolism and therefore the risk factors for those participants to develop heart disease later in life.
