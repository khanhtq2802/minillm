We're used to ordering a higher quality breakfast or brunch, and was afraid to partake in this because my wife frequently ordered it.\nSecond, the Pulled Pork Benedict was mediocre. The crust was chewy, and the meat was dry. Overall, we would give this a 3.5 star rating, as we're not repeat customers and had no complains.\nThird, the Succotash was by far the best deal we picked. We've been coming to this restaurant for years, and we've never had a bad experience. Great service, clean place, and friendly people. This is just a perfectly average experience.\nFourth, the overall cost of this meal was reasonable. We were only expecting around $15 for the pulled pork. The restaurant was close to a Tenderloin, so my guess is it's relatively inexpensive. We're happy with the food and would highly recommend this spot for future meals.\n\nOverall, 4 stars gives this spot 4.5 / 5 stars,"}

There are so many shots of people being beaten, tased, pushed, pushed into difficult positions etc that would make even a hardened apologist for the movie nervous. It is most likely the director was fed up with this aspect of the movie and wanted to get rid of it later on. II. the acting is atrocious. While most of the characters have great dialogues they speak in generic halting tones and have no effort put into their acting. III. the music is equally atrocious. The opening and closing credits are composed by John Kander, who is known for orchestral compositions, but chose to use a synth-pop soundtrack for the duration of the credits. Further, there is a blatant lack of attention to the acting, with one shot even showing flashes of red blood which is not cool. \n\nSo, while the rest of the movie passes many standards, including being a great documentary on its own, it falls short of being great."}
