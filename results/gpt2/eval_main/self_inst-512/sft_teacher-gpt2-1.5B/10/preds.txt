Sam tried to explain to the child that their trail was dangerous and they should go back home. The child continued to cry and shuffle in his seat, seemingly oblivious to Sam and Lila's presence. <n><n>When Sam tried to engage the child in a conversation, he found that he had jumped the gun.

He was simply too young to make decisions, and too old to learn from your experiences.<n><n><n>After a lengthy discussion, the child came to the realization that he was lost, and needed to take a different path home. He thanked Sam for helping him find his way back to civilization, and extended his thanks to Lila for finding him a ride home. Sam was left feeling disappointed, but not entirely surprised. He knew that kids these days were too young to make proper decisions, and even more so to cry in public.<n><n>He had assumed that having more experience would make him a better guide, but now he was beginning to realize that he still had a long way to go.

The health benefits of apple juice are undeniable, and powered by the eggs and sugar produced by daylight. This recipe is not difficult to execute, and can be done ahead of time, making it an easy weeknight meal. Please enjoy!

Then there were the so-called "Artful Dodgers" like Guillermo Del Toro, who dove into the metaphorical deep end and brought us scenes of quiet desperation.<n><n>The early 00s saw a lot of cinematography that tried to capture the raw atmosphere of the movies. The "dead Poets Society" is a great example, with its use of handheld cameras, sad piano music, and large-scale silhouettes. The use of light also became more and more important, especially in the movies of the time, with everything from bulbs to car windows being used for light.<n><n>One interesting trend is the shift from linear to non-linear narrative.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Answer the following question.<n><n>### Input:<n>How do I compare strings in Java?<n>I've been using the == operator in my program to compare all my strings so far. However, I ran into a bug, changed one of them into.equals() instead, and it fixed the bug.<n>Is == bad? When should it and should it not be used? What's the difference?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Should == be used only for string comparisons? If so, this is how you would use it in Java:<n><n>String s1 = "Fred" + "Barney" ;<n><n>String s2 = "Fred" + ". Barney" ;<n><n>Although this is more concise, it may not be as efficient as using == for other types of comparisons, such as identifier lookups.
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context.

The task is to evaluate each answer and determine if it is correct. If incorrect, explain why.<n><n>### Input:<n>Is there a way of reading one single character from the user input? For instance, they press one key at the terminal and it is returned (sort of like getch()). I know there's a function in Windows for it, but I'd like something that is cross-platform.<n>Answer 1: Here's a link to the ActiveState Recipes site that says how you can read a single character in Windows, Linux and OSX :<n>https://code.activestate.com/recipes/134892/<n>Answer 2: if you just want to hold the screen so you can see the result on the terminal just write `input()` at the end of the code and it will hold the screen<n><n>### Response:<n>		There isn't a way of performing this task in Windows, Linux or OSX because there is no function that can perform the action you seek. Possible solutions include: <n>- Create a console applet (e.g., using the WinJS API)<n>- Use a third-party read-only API like readline()<n>- Allow the terminal to read from standard input (e.g., via Control C)

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>You will need to guide this person through the scenario they have described for the interview.<n><n>### Input:<n>Finally! After a while of shooting in the dark and frantically fiddling with sample inputs on the whiteboard, you've came up with an algorithm for solving the coding question your interviewer gave you.<n>Whew. Such a relief to have a clear path forward. To not be flailing anymore.<n>Now you're cruising, getting ready to code up your solution.<n>When suddenly, your interviewer throws you a curve ball.<n>"What if we thought of the problem this way?"<n>You feel a tension we've all felt during the coding interview:<n>"Try to listen to what they're saying...but don't lose your train of thought...ugh, I can't do both!"<n><n>### Response:<n>		Ok, let's try this again.<n>"Imagine a taxi driver delivering a package to a customer. The taxi driver reaches under the hood of the car and retrieves a cash box. He then puts the money into the box, and the taxi driver takes the customer to their home. Is this scenario plausible? <n><n>If the taxi driver in the example above had simply reached under the hood of the taxi and retrieved the cash box, most people would consider this scenario to be entirely implausible. Why? Because it would require him to ignore his standard operating procedure and act irresponsibly, which is generally not the behaviour of taxi drivers.<n><n>But if the taxi driver in the scenario above had used some magic code to secret the cash box, then most people would consider this code to be plausible. In this case, the code would have to ensure that if the customer asked for the cash box back, the taxi driver would actually return the money to the customer (revealing the secret), and the customer would actually be able to pay the taxi driver via the normal fare.<n><n>So in summary, your interviewer asks you to think of the problem as though it were a payment transaction, and you respond by focusing on the aspects of the scenario that make it obvious

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Describe the content of the article in a brief manner.<n><n>### Input:<n>A study published earlier this year by Zee and her team examined the role of light in sleep for healthy adults in their 20s. Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.<n><n>### Response:<n>		A study published last year by Zee and colleagues examined the role of light (dimming) in sleep for healthy adults between the ages of 20 and 40. Participants were given different methods of staying awake during the night, such as having a TV set with the volume lower or going to sleep with the lights off. The results of this study suggested that going to sleep with the light on was significantly more beneficial than going to sleep without any light at all. As a result, people who went to sleep with the lights on had higher blood sugar levels and a lower heart rate during the night.

I now live in Bucharest, Romania, where I work as a software engineer. When I first arrived in Romania, I thought the only difference between me and other people was my accent. I was so wrong. Everyone speaks Romanian, and it's widely spoken at home. In school, I didn't speak any Romanian, so I just took it for granted. I didn't realize how different I would feel until I moved to Romania and saw how different it was for me. I realized that despite all the differences, I was still a gregarious person who enjoyed interacting with others. I realized that if I kept to myself, everything would be okay. I could let my guard down and be open with people. I could even learn to love the language. I had never thought I would miss so desperately to speak another language, but here I am.
