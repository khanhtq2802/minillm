{"text": "While the overall tale is fairly standard, the creators do take some risks. Most notably, they introduce a new character, Miriam, and give her a more fleshed out backstory. Also, they switch up the standard sword-and-sorcery formula in quite a creative way. While the book is largely plot-driven, there are plenty of character moments, and even a bit of character growth on the part of the main protagonist. Overall, The Rings of Power is a highly entertaining read, and I enjoyed it greatly."}
{"text": "Sam and Lila were hiking near a tiny creek when they came across a small child crying. Sam tried to explain to the child that their trail was dangerous and they should go back home. The child continued to cry and shuffle in his seat, seemingly oblivious to Sam and Lila's presence. \n\nWhen Sam tried to engage the child in a conversation, he found that he had jumped the gun. The child was too young to understand elementary conversation skills, and even less so to understand how to express your point of view. He was simply too young to make decisions, and too old to learn from your experiences.\n\n\nAfter a lengthy discussion, the child came to the realization that he was lost, and needed to take a different path home. He thanked Sam for helping him find his way back to civilization, and extended his thanks to Lila for finding him a ride home. Sam was left feeling disappointed, but not entirely surprised. He knew that kids these days were too young to make proper decisions, and even more so to cry in public.\n\nHe had assumed that having more experience would make him a better guide, but now he was beginning to realize that he still had a long way to go."}

We could already see directors like Roger Deakins, who'd taken on film-noir themes, or Lucas Steele, who'd made documentaries work. Then there were the so-called \"Artful Dodgers\" like Guillermo Del Toro, who dove into the metaphorical deep end and brought us scenes of quiet desperation.\n\nThe early 00s saw a lot of cinematography that tried to capture the raw atmosphere of the movies. The \"dead Poets Society\" is a great example, with its use of handheld cameras, sad piano music, and large-scale silhouettes. The use of light also became more and more important, especially in the movies of the time, with everything from bulbs to car windows being used for light.\n\nOne interesting trend is the shift from linear to non-linear narrative.

He then puts the money into the box, and the taxi driver takes the customer to their home. Is this scenario plausible? \n\nIf the taxi driver in the example above had simply reached under the hood of the taxi and retrieved the cash box, most people would consider this scenario to be entirely implausible. Why? Because it would require him to ignore his standard operating procedure and act irresponsibly, which is generally not the behaviour of taxi drivers.\n\nBut if the taxi driver in the scenario above had used some magic code to secret the cash box, then most people would consider this code to be plausible. In this case, the code would have to ensure that if the customer asked for the cash box back, the taxi driver would actually return the money to the customer (revealing the secret), and the customer would actually be able to pay the taxi driver via the normal fare.\n\nSo in summary, your interviewer asks you to think of the problem as though it were a payment transaction, and you respond by focusing on the aspects of the scenario that make it obvious"}

She quickly turned around and saw a shiny, new truck sitting there. She wondered what could have been up there, and began to research the truck's history. Eventually, she realized that it was a Shining, and she had been watching it all along. She quickly sat down in the living room and cried like a baby. The truck's owner, the Spirit of Christmas, came down the hall and embraced her. He said that she was His beautiful and lost lamb, and that she was now His very own."}
