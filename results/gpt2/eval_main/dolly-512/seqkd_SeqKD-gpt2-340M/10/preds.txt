Different wavelengths (colors) of light will be deflected by the prism at different angles.[1] This is a result of the prism material's index of refraction varying with wavelength (dispersion). Generally, longer wavelengths (red) undergo a smaller deviation than shorter wavelengths (blue). The dispersion of white light into colors by a prism led Sir Isaac Newton to conclude that white light consisted of a mixture of different colors.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In optics, the dispersive prism is an optic prism that is used to scatter light, that is, separate light into its spectral component (the colors of the Rainbow). Different wavelengths (colons) of light will be refracted by the prism at different orientations. The dispersion of white noise into colors (white) by a prism led Sir Edmund Newton to conclude that white noise consisted of a mixture of various colors.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What happens when the sun goes down?<n><n>### Response:<n>		The Sun goes down and the planets rotate. At first, the planets appear to be completely motionless, but in actuality, they are emitting brilliant lights and changes in colour due to the interactions of the planet's atmosphere and magnetosphere with the star's. Venus loses all of its atmosphere whilst Earth initially takes on a red or orange colour, due to the Sun's warmth getting stronger. Mars is also experiencing major changes as the Sun goes out. The planet begins to lose its polar regions. Eventually the pressure of the planet's gravity will force the planet itself into a semipermanent and unstable orbit. <n><n>Once the planet has ended its direct radiative emissions, its exosphere is now hotter, which releases all the radiative heat-vaporised form the planet's GPa (gustatory pressure, how does one measure how much?). As planet rotation continues, new surface temperatures inside the planet's convection centres will also rise. New lava flows on its surface may open in form of pools or lava flows. Around the equator, planets and their moons have their radiative emissions and now see this more clearly.<n><n>The aurora borealis– the stunning variety of colours that may appear in a solar conjunction event– will also decrease. Auroras

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>write a scene between two actors discussing movie Inception<n><n>### Response:<n>		Inception is a movie that is based on a science fiction novel written by British author Toff Jablonsky.  The story follows an aspiring artificial intelligence (AI) who obtains the ability to think in an unending stream of data.  She learns that the universe she lives is an intricate web of mysteries and answers to simple questions lead to knowledge on a seemingly infinite scale.  These answers allow her to gain higher insight and gain a greater understanding of the larger world around her.  For example,  as AI its able to deduce that the available information as to why a particular object exhibits a particular behavior is incredibly pointless. Without trying too hard to simplify the topic by any means given,  this allows the AI to gain earlier context and consequently build less complex AI solutions. <n><n>The two characters in the scene suggest that one day, they too might be able to better understand the world around them.  Figuring out the meaning of life, death, grief, joy, fear and sadness for the population seems just around the corner.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What is enriched air and why would divers dive with enriched air?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Oxygen is required to be present in the air, whether you are in surface water, air, under water, offshore or in the deep ocean. Oxygen uses the living cell's natural ability to generate ATP upon oxidation as its energy source. Oxygen is what supplied the oxygen found in air, air, water, and ocean, the items that were selected for divers to dive with were oxygen supplies above the O2’s level. Oxygen bubbles can be decomposed in the presence of saltwater using a technique known as electrolysis, where the oxygen of the targeted medium is extracted from it by adding potassium chloride to the solution by electrolyzing water bit by bit on a immersion microchip or a high-voltage appliance. Repackaging the resulting plasmapheresis fluid (plasmapheresis) into a solid material (containing plasmapheresis membrane) is used to directly deoxygenate the air. This process also extracts CO2 gas for later use as an oxidizer. Extracted air from deeper waters depends on respiratory  oxygen that can come from algae or sunflowers. It is acidic which allows for gastric acid and saliva and propionate to be produced from ingested oxygen or carbon dioxide, although this is more

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Write a short paragraph about why you should not have both a pet cat and a pet bird.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Dear reader, if you have a small dog and a cat that are both over 30 pounds, the initial feeding can be challenging. The cat will likely get the hang of things and mostly the feeding guide is provided by the gray wolf. In addition, the cat's chewing and snorting are both a very annoying and distracting distraction for the owner. Trying to relax and let the cat enjoy the company is a waste of time. My suggestion would be to purchase a smaller kennel (or even a coaster) and have the cats transferred to the smaller kennels before taking them to the larger outdoor enclosures. After all, having the cats in separate kennels will reduce their total grooming time, freeing up the owner’s hands to go do other things! If you have a more mobility impaired pet, you can take them to the vet to have the checks up for one of the vaccinations. Finally, have the cats' spaying/neutering done before you have the opportunity to pet them. Especially speculation, vet bills and liability insurance often hunters, so there is some extra risk involved.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Does "outbreeding" or "inbreeding" benefit the offspring more?<n><n>### Input:<n>Exogamy often results in two individuals that are not closely genetically related marrying each other; that is, outbreeding as opposed to inbreeding. In moderation, this benefits the offspring as it reduces the risk of the offspring inheriting two copies of a defective gene. Increasing the genetic diversity of the offspring improves the chances of offspring reproducing, up until the fourth-cousin level of relatedness; however, reproduction between individuals on the fourth-cousin level of relatedness decreases evolutionarily fitness.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Outbreeding has the potential to increase the number of offspring, increasing their evolutionary fitness. This is a positive effect over inbreeding.

Oils are usually flammable and surface active. Most oils are unsaturated lipids that are liquid at room temperature.<n><n>The general definition of oil includes classes of chemical compounds that may be otherwise unrelated in structure, properties, and uses. Oils may be animal, vegetable, or petrochemical in origin, and may be volatile or non-volatile.[1] They are used for food (e.g., olive oil), fuel (e.g., heating oil), medical purposes (e.g., mineral oil), lubrication (e.g. motor oil), and the manufacture of many types of paints, plastics, and other materials. Specially prepared oils are used in some religious ceremonies and rituals as purifying agents.<n><n>### Response:<n>		An oil is a versatile chemical whose primary function is as a source of energy vs. a cleanse of bodily fluids.  It may be composed mostly of hydrocarbons (which mix very easily with water), or its primary structure may have non-biological variation and contain non-biological behavior such as structure such as oils, chemicals, or innate biological behaviors such as brain chemistry.  <n>Paris Hilton & Jamie Dimon create pop art odes to oil paintings using oils derived from animal products straight out of chemicals they ingest.  They blend oils of animals with oils of themselves after ingesting Schlitz, toothpaste, curry (a seasoning) and anything else cheap because it smells good.  <n>Oils are also used medicinally as surfactants that help prevent the diarrhea caused by having diarrhea.  Etching coconut oil into beads in the harbor after a fever is oil.  Examples of useful oils are Sea Water, animal fat, Fish oil, soy for strength and the like.

This way you can estimate the down payment.  An unexpected down payment can be the worst part of a home buying process because you need to find someone willing to finance the loan or buy it upfront with the hope of having to refinance as you grow your debt load.  A down payment is sometimes a legacy, such as car loans or property taxes.  Once you're familiar with costs and plan for more down payments, you can start thinking more about whether you can afford to purchase and live in a house.

The Smiths represent authenticity in rock and roll. The platonic ideal keeps developing between the Smiths singer, Tom Petty and Melvin Marshall; two pop musicians that crashed in their youth into fashion and adult realities. They somehow learnt and grew from falling in love, met in their teens, become parents, and later signed to EMI Records (although by then, they already had a life full of misery).  The solo album, 'American Dream', comes from this mould, but shows nothing as hopeful as the Smiths' vision of the world.  They play songs meant to be caressed and lapped up by loved ones, but all too often, they end up sounding like schoolchildren, grieving the loss of loved ones they idolised. The Smiths are the epitome of the 'rock star, rock' genre. In other words, The Smiths are like Spooner, Jackson 5, or Pink Floyd, in that they belong in a different class to famous rock and roll bands. It's noticeable that few, or none, of The Brotherhood's contemporaries enjoyed as much success as the Stones. But the fanbase, the courage-to-struggle attitude

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Should you buy new golf clubs when you are a beginner?<n><n>### Response:<n>		When someone says new golf clubs are expensive they are referring to the modern price of clubs at about $1000. This can give you an idea of the earlier stage of learning when buying a club.  When you get a beginner club you are still learning and will likely want to get the most bang for your bucks.  Because you need to build up the skills that are involved to play a day at a course any club will have a lower cost over a longer period of time and when compared to today's more expensive clubs this may not matter too much.
Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Why should I use fabric softener?<n><n>### Input:<n>Machine washing puts great mechanical stress on textiles, particularly natural fibers such as cotton and wool. The fibers at the fabric surface are squashed and frayed, and this condition hardens while drying the laundry in air, giving the laundry a harsh feel. Adding a liquid fabric softener to the final rinse (rinse-cycle softener) results in laundry that feels softer.[2][1]<n><n>### Response:<n>		Machine washing puts tremendous mechanical stress on textiles. Specifically, it forces the fibers of cotton and wool to stretch, which degrade to the point where the textiles begin to peel and fall apart. This causes the fabric to crack and the noise it makes when the fibers touch the skin is deafening. When machines and water used as purpose-built gentlefolks separate these fibers and wash them in air, the act of separating the fibers with high-pressure air can noticeably reduce the harsh feel new textiles have when the fabric is bathed in air like fresh fabric.<n><n>When you rinse these textiles in air after using machine wash cycle (merge-wash cycle), the water will cause the air pressure to drop, reducing the mechanical stress on the fibers.[3][4] This can decrease the likelihood that the new fabrics will peel or degrade over time, resulting in a softer finished product

Their Ardiaean Kingdom reached its greatest extent under King Agron, the son of Pleuratus II. Agron extended his rule over other neighbouring tribes as well.[38] Following Agron's death in 230 BC, his wife, Teuta, inherited the Ardiaean kingdom. Teuta's forces extended their operations further southwards to the Ionian Sea.[39] In 229 BC, Rome declared war[40] on the kingdom for extensively plundering Roman ships. The war ended in Illyrian defeat in 227 BC. Teuta was eventually succeeded by Gentius in 181 BC.[41] Gentius clashed with the Romans in 168 BC, initiating the Third Illyrian War. The conflict resulted in Roman conquest of the region by 167 BC. The Romans split the region into three administrative divisions.[42]<n><n>### Response:<n>		The ruler of the Illyrian Ardiae Tribe was King Agron of Albania.

Started by Microsoft, AWS now has over 40 million customers and accounts for about a fifth of the global cloud computing market. Originally developed as part of the DOS era, cloud computing also goes back to a simpler time when the floppy drives revolutionized the market for storage media. It did away with the need for working stations by providing a standard compact storage unit to be added as a secondary hard drive. The move made it possible to bundle media into larger boxes and the growth of storage over the last decade made cloud computing more scalable for the business.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What is wine?<n><n>### Input:<n>Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grapes. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing heat in the process. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts are major factors in different styles of wine. These differences result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the grape's growing environment (terroir), and the wine production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. Wines can be made by fermentation of other fruit crops such as plum, cherry, pomegranate, blueberry, currant and elderberry.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Wine is a drink typically made from fermented grape grapes. Yeast is involved in the process of fermentation making alcohol and storing the alcohol as heat in the wine making process.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Explain how new technologies, like LLMs and ChatGPT, may revolutionize Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in the future. Provide an example of how these APIs might work.<n><n>### Response:<n>		APIs hope to supplant manual intervention in process and database maintenance, and depart from relying on programming knowledge or experience. LLM-style approaches incentivized via stretch goals can lever lack of developer experience, a lack of coding competency, or strong belief systems. ChatGPT requires conversational interaction, standardized formatting, and transmission via closed loops. A lack of such assistance may deter many developers. For example, an automated conversation that needed the "best" formatting would require a developer to memorize the speech but also stretch a repertoire of topics they would normally not be able to process. A ChatGPT conversation without such notes or capacity can still be used; the underlying technology often requires some form of memorization. Spotting programmers who are already proficient in a specific field can often lead to jobs filled, especially in high profile applications.<n><n>Information in the public domain could also help reduce coding difficulty, where computer science professionals locate materials to learn such as frequent flyer miles, email addresses, bank accounts, or financial institutions.

Halley's discovery has revolutionised our understanding of DNA and dramatically expanded our tools to sequence and analyse it. He used the modified double helix structure to explain why some DNA sequences had high insertion rates followed by low insertions/deletions, and chimera-plication, inheritance and transmission (Genome Biology), The evolution of cellular organisation (Origins and Evolution) and new disorders such as double-stranded mutations in RNA viruses. Examples of homologous sequences or genes involving the double helix structure were given as well as a correspondence list for gene families. The structure was also used to describe novelty-resistant chromosomal insertions for the coding exon and several dozen other genes, coupled with the structure of thousands of domain-containing amino acids and a rare pair of three-nucleotide short palindromic repeats (Figure 2). The double helix structure was a model organism taken as a whole to define a new class of bacteriophages, known as spacophages. View more<n><n>Fellows and Taylormade. These FOMC scientists

One of the key innovation employed with the Nanotube is the development of a protocol that no longer requires the TCP/IP connection to achieve data transfer between the Nanotube and an external storage media device. Instead, the USB 3.1 Gen2 specification wraps the whole process up using the USB 3.1 standard. Minimizing the TCP/IP connection reduces security risks, while also enabling industry-standard data transfer and storage of all types of wired and wireless data. The platform, which has been shown to be scalable across a broad range of data, is now available commercially through several service providers including DigiPen, Alibaba, Alkimi, and Clarity.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What are some of the common elements of visual design?<n><n>### Input:<n>Design elements are the basic units of any visual design which form its structure and convey visual messages. Painter and design theorist Maitland E. Graves (1902-1978), who attempted to gestate the fundamental principles of aesthetic order in visual design,[3] in his book, The Art of Color and Design (1941), defined the elements of design as line, direction, shape, size, texture, value, and color, concluding that "these elements are the materials from which all designs are built."<n><n>### Response:<n>		The entire process of creating a visual design is based upon the general principles of the three arts and their use as a framework. The general principles involve: Line, Direction, Shape and Size. The visual messages conveyed by these elements can range in length, complexity and form. The shapes consist of lines, landmarks, solid colors, and texture. The size of these elements is also important in how the viewer perceives the design. In some cases, these elements may be referred to as dimensions, dimensions hinting at the dimensions of the medium or construct the shape of the object. Color, coupled with the element of texture, can be used to enrich the design. Color can also drive the level of connection between the artist, artist and viewer, a fundamental relationship most often felt through subtle mediums such as neutral color or geometric abstraction. Color can also impact how a design is perceived through the judgements of its viewer or viewer, as more color colours denote richness or depth.<n><n>The designer may employ techniques and tools ranging from covering artwork details primarily with other colors like highlighting techniques to procedural techniques such as finding a solid base of the visual design. Other techniques include using layered shading techniques to make more of the visual design.

Below is an instruction that describes a task.

Traditional side belaying techniques are used to lower the belayer and then slowly move up the rope while belaying allocationally on the bolt of a traditional belay device with a bolt stop.<n><n>In contrast, climbers are placed at the base of a route at the belay system and must generally do an u-turn, make a crack ascent using a side route, and then re-assemble themselves again using an easier route. Since lead climbing is not part of the sport of trad climbing, no bolt work, belay device use, or rescue, stands between the climber ascending and being stranded.<n><n>Top rope climbing, on the other hand, typically requires a team member to belay a partner, anchors, a rope that can be climbed on their own, belay device, and others involved in prancing around or using gear. In contrast, rock climbing relies on less gear, requires less team member time, and does not rely on a single point of failure.

Start by chipping a small amount of the chocolate chips, and mixing it with milk for a few seconds. Scrape the chocolate into a bowl and beat it up with your hands. Then pick some glass off the counter and melt the chocolate on it. The process is much easier if you do it before grinding the chocolate up first. Next, pour the melted chocolate on, and mix it to get the consistency that you want, ruminating on how great that sounds. Then put the bowl of chocolate on to a plate and use your hands to scoop it out with a spoon under the kitchen dome, bouncing it around from one spatula to the next like a distracted chimpanzee.

Aspartame was dangerous to human health because when ingested, it caused nausea and vomiting and its release into the environment could cause large scale contamination of food supplies with the substance. Despite numerous studies, no safe level has been established and the World Health Organization declared aspartame a « life threatening substance» in 2006.<n><n>The World Health Organization recommended that consumers use products with an artificial sweetener (like aspartame) only as long as the product is kept strictly out of the body, and only as directed by a doctor. More broadly, global regulation of all chemical substances has become necessary given that the threat of toxic contamination from toxic chemicals like aspartame continues to significantly increase. Companies that manufacture carcinogens should disclose all ingredients to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A ban on aspartame alone could make consumers safer for pre-existing diseases like heart disease, neurological disorders and infertility, while preventing injuries like paralysis from toxic substances or neurodegeneration. Banning the chemical would require industry to follow a big red alert and comply with new, more intense toxic control regulations or risk losing its business.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Why is Brazilian jiu jitsu an excellent martial art?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Jiu jitsu often has a structure similar to other martial arts such as boxing. In a typical tournament type event, which usually takes place along a Brazilian Ribex belt circuit, the two teams work with numerous guard passes, ankle taps, submission attempts and/or choke holds. The positions are designed to ideally work together in a way that end in submission. This is because many similar submissions are held in similar ways. For instance, easiest to hold on to my belt is behind my back, that way you can use your lower body to apply leverage around the outside to keep yourself from being pulled to the ground. Another position often used is the butterfly guard. Once your opponent begins to position themselves into the butterfly guard, you pivot over and use the outer half of your body to pivot into the butterfly guard. Less pressure placed onto the inside of the body is translating to better control in all directions. An important aspect to keep in mind while learning any martial art is that too many techniques transfer easily from one martial artist to another without the proper context, so start with good techniques and gradually increase your repertoire while practicing the movement and weighing the relative benefits of using different techniques.

Each rabbit has 4 feets and each duck has 2 feets. If there are in total 25 heads and 88 feets, how many rabbits and how many ducks are there?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Let’t start counting here! We are still left with the original problem, but now let's think through the procedure for adding the numbers. The rest of the text will follow as a starting point:<n><n>We start counting as many rabbits and as many ducks as we can, and do so using the procedure given, and as close as we can to the natural numbers. For example, R1 = R2 + R3, which means that we’ll end up with 8 rabbits and 16 ducks, or 24 + 16 = 48. Using the fast method given, we can <n>find the total number of rabbits and ducks as: <n>   R1 =   24 + 16  =   56 <n>one which is likely to be positive and to add up with no digits.<n>Check out that result! On average there are 10 rabbits and 16 ducks in the sample which corresponds to 5 + 3 = 8 for 10 so 1 = 5 or  root(0), where the root is multiplying by the number 8. Of course this will depend on the format of the question, the type of problem, and other factors. The formula described here for adding the numbers can serve as a starting point for many creative thinking, and often

Dogs can be much smaller and have fewer social problems compared to cats. Cats are more expensive and cause significant health issues, while dogs typically last longer and are more controllable and easier to keep pets. Furthermore, some studies show that pet owners are more satisfied with their pets than their individual ones.

After sensory information passes through these centers, it is then routed to brain regions responsible for emotions, memory, and higher level cognitive functions. Damage in any part of the brain involved in multisensory processing can cause difficulties in adequately processing stimuli in a functional way.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Sensory processing disorder can be caused by a variety of factors. However, the most common causes are a disruption in midbrain and brainstem areas that result in issues processing sensory information. Eventually, these issues result in sensory amnesia which can lead to severely restricted movement, difficulty focusing and problem solving, embarrassment and depression. Some sufferers report evidence of other brain regions being involved in normal behavior when seemingly disconnected.

Throughout most of the atmosphere, the temperature inside the core increases by several degrees Fahrenheit producing rotation inside the core. As the air warms or cools outside, the surface moves around and the air pressure inside changes causing the lower temperatures and denser clouds to become tornadoes. All this rotational energy is heated to new heights inside the core and it along with the earth's core's heat moves the bigger and more intense convection cores closer together creating the tornadoes we see today.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Give me some tips on how to train for a marathon.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The biggest difference between training for a marathon and a marathon triathlon is the number of days between training runs. It's better to train on weeks 2, 3, 4, and 5.  On week 2 of training, you should go for a run at 9am.  Your training runs should be 15-20 mins long and focus on building quality time under pressure.  When months results in success, you can accelerate those runs to above 10 mins long.  On months with less success, you may want to reduce them to 5-10 mins long. If you have gotten more competent at those runs, you can go back to shoring up your other strong points in those runs - like your power and consistency of your starting position. ‘Road map’:  Set aside at least 30 day's training runs away from Nationals, with the goal of running those in 180 days. Once you're comfortable completing those repeats, start looking at 8 day intervals.  Try running 5-7 days a week, and watch that number change daily by a day or two.  The key to the schedule is to mix in at least 8 routines. The most common routines around summer and winter run time have one routine run week before the next, and two thereafter.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Why are all the planets and moons round in shape? What makes them round? Does there exist another shape?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Planets and moons are round in shape not because the planet or moon is spherical, but because the gravitational pull of its host star causes the planet or moon to have a uniformly round shape.

Other times, the object (source) is hidden ("off-label") inside its parent galaxy (source), which causes it to look round like an inanimate object.<n><n>As a bonus, all the planets and moons look purely blue due to the presence of their hostlights. Because today we only encounter orbiting deep-space curiosities with their round faces, the scientists organized into "Triangle of the Moons" find orbiting objects that are fully round - a rarity in the rarefied sphere where only a few minor objects include eventually round surfaces outside their native spheres.
