Holding the oars too tightly or making adjustments to technique may cause recurring or new blisters, as it is common to feather the blade. Another common injury is getting "track bites", thin cuts on the back of one's calf or thigh caused by contact with the seat tracks at either end of the stroke.[53]<n><n>### Response:<n>		Rowing is low impact, so the occurrence of most rowing injuries is infrequent.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What is the best swimming form?<n><n>### Response:<n>		The best form of swimming is a heat stroke.  Heat stroke is when you swim fast laps in a pool and backstroke in a similar fashion.  The reason it's called a heat stroke is that the water in the pool is denser than the air and the air canister delivers more water vapor to the swimming surface.  The faster you swim, the more water vapor touches the bottom of the pool and mixes with the water from your stomach and back.  This creates a suction effect that pulls the water out of the pool and into the water.  Some people go to great lengths to create this look, others resort to look less dramatic and simply take a look at the bottom of the pool with a purist view.

A Granny Smith apple, on the other hand, has no such fermented batter and is generally what is known as an "unsweetened apple".<n><n>Typically, the red delicious is served with syrup as a substitute for the original fruit.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What's the best way to learn how to snowboard?<n><n>### Response:<n>		The first step to learning how to snowboard is getting on a chair lift and learning how to balance.  This will help you to get a good hang of snowboarding and also learn how to ride a slope.  After you get a hang of this first step and are comfortable riding on a chair lift, you can continue to ride until you are comfortable riding in small to medium snow.  This is called an "unfinished" snowboard.  Unfinished snowboard is riding on unpaved roads and is very difficult to ride.  You will learn to ride on unpaved road by slowly advancing your technique while hanging onto a chair lift.  Staying on the stable lift for the majority of your ride is very important because it teaches you the fundamental skill of balancing on your two skis.  When you are comfortable on your two skis, you will be able to ride almost any terrain that snowboard can throw at you.  This includes off-roading, cliff jumps, jumps to new areas, and even uphill/downhill jumps!  Because you are learning how to ride a snowboard, you also need to start throwing at snow to learn how to make those tricky turns.  After learning how to make turns, you should feel confident turning onto

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Imagine a world where life expectancy is fixed and the same for everyone at birth, yet people can engage in life expectancy "donation" – meaning that someone can extend your life three years longer at the expense of theirs. Talk about a likely scenario in this world that involves manipulated, coerced donation.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Many people today would like to extend their own life expectancy at the expense of theirs by donation. For example, people who wish to have children may wish to have children at a younger age, so that they can enjoy their time with their loved ones and avoid the burden of ongoing child care. Or, they may wish to have children so that they can provide financial assistance to those who are unable to have children themselves, or simply because they think they might enjoy having another child. Many people do not wish to have more children, because they want to maintain the family unit, or they want to begin a new chapter in their lives.<n><n>However, under certain conditions, people mayuntarily choose not to have children. For example, some people may not want to become elderly until they have had many children, or they may want to wait until they have close to no children before having children. Still others may not want to have children until they have had little experience with children, or they may desire to have a different view about children than others.<n><n>By donation or not, people can extend their own life expectancy by allowing others to extend theirs.

Both sides build their pieces, with some planning, and with the pawn structure showing some weird kingside angles. It's a good idea to get a piece down low, even if it is not too far from the center.<n>- The Fianchetto defense. You build a rook at the same location each move. First, checkmate the King. Second, checkmate the Queen and move your pieces 1 space forward. Third, move your pieces two steps apart, and so on. <n>- The Rook Defense: There is not much moving here. Just stand still and let the rook do some weird stuff.<n>- TheKnight's Pawn Opening: Build a knight and move it forward 3 spaces.

How can I fix it.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Multi-threading can increase performance but there are some counter-intuitive results that can affect performance. The most common technique involves reducing the number of threading operations (e.g., adding or subtracting one thread). This is often done by using locks (and, typically, raising a locks. Each thread can lock onto the next thread, blocking until the number of threads is greater than the current thread. Thus, in Python, each thread has a "granularity" that it can use to enforce tasks. If all the threads have the same granularity, then they will be able to do the same work in parallel, which can improve performance. Of course, this depends on the specific use case and the skills of the programmer.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What is the greatest movie of all time?<n><n>### Response:<n>		According to the Guinness Book of World Records as of 1995, the "Greatest Movie of All Time" is a combination of "The Godfather Part 2", "The Godfather Part 1", and "The Godfather Part 4". This largely consists of one or more movies, each with a different cast and subject, that each had an amazing success and set of cinematic highlights and observations. The original "The Godfather" setting is quite similar to the present day setting of many of these movies, even though it was nearly two decades before the events of the "The Godfather Part 5" and so may not be entirely correct. One possible revision to the story is that one of the founders of the resistance, E.G. Waters, was a pioneer of the Vietnam War and thus was considered to be "The Greatest Movie of All Time". Another idea is that of Sergio Leone, whose "Reservoir Dogs" is arguably the greatest. Many would argue that "The Godfather Part 6" could be considered the greatest since Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" in that it actually contains the best and the most unintentionally humorous sequence, with key and eventful scenes at both ends of the movie. In any case, the sticky nature of

It was a reaction against the Church's monopoly on the interpretation of Bible through the Protestant Reformation. The word "reformation" is derived from the Germanic names of the new religions.  The new constitution declared that Catholics, who were previously taxed and regulated, would be free to teach their faith if they so desired.  Many were disappointed that this legislation did not include universal contraception for all Church members.<n>Like the reform movements of the late medieval times, the Counter Reformation largely involved changing the legal status of non-Protestant Christians. The Church retained absolute power to interpret the Bible in parishes, cities, and lay people's wills. Only officially recognized sects of the Church maintained their own legal system. The Counter Reformation had wide support from across the English-speaking world.<n>Like other movements for change, the Counter Reformation had a social and political dimension. It challenged the Church's authority over people's lives, property, education, and lifestyles. The gains made by the Counter Reformation were uneven, as some people were indifferent to Church teaching on social issues or who simply did not subscribe to its teachings.  Luther and Calvin were
