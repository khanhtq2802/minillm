It portrays Jesus as a teacher, an exorcist, a healer, and a miracle worker, though it does not expound upon the miraculous birth or divine pre-existence.\n3) The Gospel of Luke - tells of the origins, birth, ministry, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ.\n4) The Gospel of John -  It contains a highly schematic description of the ministry of Jesus, with seven \"signs\" culminating in the raising of Lazarus and seven \"I am\" discourses culminating in Thomas' proclamation of the risen Jesus as \"my Lord and my God\". The gospel's concluding verses set out its purpose, \"that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,"}

They're naturally very hard to see and often swim hidden in the sand. Magic worm or tremolo hooks are the most efficient way to catch smallmouth bass. Make sure you use a deep, flat bottomed rake hook that will not sink in water. The smaller the hook, the more weight it will have on it. For example, a size 3 hook will weigh about 30 pounds. Slap the hook on to theilus of the smallmouth bass and drag it under water for approximately 10 feet. The bass will then swim to the surface and be Suddenly and unexpectedly attracted to the hook."}

{"text": "Data Engineering occurs before data science in the data lifecycle. Data can be generated from various sources and this raw data may be structured, semi structured or even unstructured. To make sense of this data, data has to be ingested and transformed. This is when data engineering comes into picture. Data engineering includes the process of extracting the raw data, ingesting data into a system like a data lake, transforming the data for business needs and finally loading it into a table. This is commonly known as ELT (Extract-Load-Transform). ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) is also possible where transformation happens before the loading stage.\nData Science and Analytics is the next step in the data lifecycle\nWhen data needed for specific business need is available, data scientists use this data to run machine learning models to find the most accurate model. This data is available to the data scientists in the form of tables. Data analysts also use this data to do some exploratory analysis and create dashboards. \nIn essence, the data lifecycle would look as follows:\nRaw data from different sources -> Data Engineering -> Data Science and Analytics"}
