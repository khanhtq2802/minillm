Different wavelengths (colors) of light will be deflected by the prism at different angles.[1] This is a result of the prism material's index of refraction varying with wavelength (dispersion). Generally, longer wavelengths (red) undergo a smaller deviation than shorter wavelengths (blue). The dispersion of white light into colors by a prism led Sir Isaac Newton to conclude that white light consisted of a mixture of different colors.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In optics, dispersive prisms are optical prisms used to scatter light into its spectrum components. The prism material's index ofrefraction varies with wavelength of light.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What happens when the sun goes down?<n><n>### Response:<n>		The sun goes down when the Earth is either on its side or its side is perpendicular to the Sun.  The earth is tidally locked and the same side of the earth is always facing the sun.  At this time the earth is 389 million miles from the sun and is therefore an order of magnitude closer to the sun than the earth is from the Sun.  As the earth approaches the sun, the pressure increases on the side of the earth that is facing the sun.  The side of the earth that was facing the sun will become entirely red, while the other side of the earth will be under water.  The air in between the earth and the sun will also begin to heat up and vaporize.  As this happens the sun will begin to withdraw its energy.  By the time the sun has completely gone down to the earth's surface the surface will be totally dark and the air will be boiling with hot air.  Animals and plants will lose energy due to the lack of sunlight.  During the day when the sun is up, the air is scalding hot and sensitive to light.  During the night when the sun is down, the air is cool and dark.  Therefore, an organism that can survive in the daytime must also be able

In moderation, this benefits the offspring as it reduces the risk of the offspring inheriting two copies of a defective gene. Increasing the genetic diversity of the offspring improves the chances of offspring reproducing, up until the fourth-cousin level of relatedness; however, reproduction between individuals on the fourth-cousin level of relatedness decreases evolutionarily fitness.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Inbreeding generally benefits the offspring more than outbreeding.

Ideally, high-fidelity equipment has inaudible noise and distortion, and a flat (neutral, uncolored) frequency response within the human hearing range.[2]<n><n>High fidelity contrasts with the lower-quality “lo-fi” sound produced by inexpensive audio equipment, AM radio, or the inferior quality of sound reproduction that can be heard in recordings made until the late 1940s.<n><n>### Response:<n>		HiFi is a high quality audio reproduction device that provides flat frequency response with uncolored sound. It is used to describe audio equipment that accurately reproduce the sound of the original source. HiFi is not to be confused with hi-fidelity, which is a higher quality audio reproduction system that lacks the flat frequency response and perceived loudness of HiFi.

Below is an instruction that describes a task.

As a child, I would instinctually assume that people worked better when they were standing.  I never thought about what it would mean to be "stared at" while sitting.  As I got older and started to consider my options, I realized that being stared at while working was not ideal.  Yes, you have your desk all sorted out and ready for action, but there is only so much you can do while being observed.  Sitting all day reduces your overall time to do what you were intended to do.  It's possible to combat this by standing throughout the day, but my experience has shown me that it's not a sustainable solution.  In the end, I decided to purchase a Standing Desk.  The desk is high-tech and efficient; my attention is never distracted while working.  The rewards of standing have been numerous.  I no longer have to stare at a computer terminal all day while attempting to write.  I can instead sit down and focus on what I'm writing for a longer period of time, thereby reducing the overall time I spend reading something toxic on the internet.  I can also sit further away from the office building if I so desire, in order to better

Data engineering includes the process of extracting the raw data, ingesting data into a system like a data lake, transforming the data for business needs and finally loading it into a table. This is commonly known as ELT (Extract-Load-Transform). ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) is also possible where transformation happens before the loading stage.<n>Data Science and Analytics is the next step in the data lifecycle<n>When data needed for specific business need is available, data scientists use this data to run machine learning models to find the most accurate model. This data is available to the data scientists in the form of tables. Data analysts also use this data to do some exploratory analysis and create dashboards. <n>In essence, the data lifecycle would look as follows:<n>Raw data from different sources -> Data Engineering -> Data Science and Analytics
