He wants to overthrow the unjust authority, the Human Empire, which he perceives as unjust. He begins manipulating events to fulfill his plan. His design for the uplifting “Earth 2” message is designed to appeal to an especially broad coalition: young people, especially idealistic idealists, idealistic scientists, and science fiction enthusiasts. The message is not that “The Truth is Out There” it is simply that “The Greatest Story Never Lived.” The message contains all the mysteries of the universe buried in plain sight. Max, using cunning, deception and manipulation, manipulates the scientific community, the public and himself. As Max expands his program, he learns that the population of Earth is extremely naive and easily swayed by his promises; the genetic engineering project that Max had secretly funded with his government funds has found a fatal flaw in the human test subjects, and Max has caused massive unintended consequences. He must find a replacement

However, the repetitive rowing action can put strain on knee joints, the spine and the tendons of the forearm, and inflammation of these are the most common rowing injuries.[52] If one rows with poor technique, especially rowing with a curved rather than straight back, other injuries may surface, including back pains and wrist injuries. Blisters occur for almost all rowers, especially in the beginning of one's rowing career, as every stroke puts pressure on the hands, though rowing frequently tends to harden hands and generate protective calluses. Holding the oars too tightly or making adjustments to technique may cause recurring or new blisters, as it is common to feather the blade. Another common injury is getting "track bites", thin cuts on the back of one's calf or thigh caused by contact with the seat tracks at either end of the stroke.[53]<n><n>### Response:<n>		Rowing involves repetitive movement in a defined range of motions. Although twist and sprain injuries aren't common,  repetitive rowing can cause strains on knees, spine, and tendons.

Yet, in recent years, we've seen dramatic increases in forest fire across the state. The problem is that forest firefighting resources are stretched thin. Firefighters often can't reach burned areas because of the smoke and ash. This leads to an out-of-control wildfire that's difficult to control -- and potentially dangerous for firefighters and others who are exposed.<n><n>This week, California leaders passed an important wildfire prevention law. It makes wildfire-fighting resources more readily available to the public and makes it a crime to burn or disturb wildfires. This law helps firefighters and other law enforcement agencies respond to wildfires, and protects people and property.

There have been many arguments made against The Smiths, including being anti-white, being politically incorrect, not having a great live show, etc.  These are all valid points that can be made against a band, but to paint The Smiths as grungy, jazly, and even politically incorrect is to paint a whole different picture.

They have a great live show, great songwriting, and are considered one of the most influential bands of the 2000's.  While all this may be true, the blame cannot be placed exclusively on the band.  The fault should be placed on the fanbase for not supporting The Smiths, for not buying their albums, and for not hanging out at live shows.  These are all reasons why one should not consider The Smiths a great band, but one must also consider other factors such as the quality of the live shows, the amount of money the band has, the popularity of the artists performing, and how influential the band is outside of the UK.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What is wine?<n><n>### Input:<n>Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grapes. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing heat in the process. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts are major factors in different styles of wine. These differences result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the grape's growing environment (terroir), and the wine production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. Wines can be made by fermentation of other fruit crops such as plum, cherry, pomegranate, blueberry, currant and elderberry.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Wine is made from grapes.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Why are we like aquariums?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Like any living being, an aquarium has a functional purpose.  It is meant to provide a place where the living thing can live a long and happy life while being cared for by a caring team of people.  Most of the time though, that's not always the case.<n>While an aquarium may provide a place where a living thing can live, there are other times when a non-living object should be kept.  The most common of these situations would be in a mollusc or in a fish tank. While those are certainly different, they are still in the nature of the trade off between caretaking an aquarium and the fish and mollusc that live there.<n>While a mollusc is meant to be kept in an aquarium, a fish tank is not.  Fish are very complex and need a lot of care.  They also live in a world full of dangerous and potentially toxic chemicals, so keeping them as pets or simply keeping them as a curiosity is a better use of your time than keeping them in an aquarium.

Through various meditation practices, we can bring our awareness to the rhythm of the breath. Through breathing in deeply one begins to focus on the sensation of cool air as it passes over our head, and the sensation of the ground as we dig our toes into the earth. Our minds naturally reticle to the sensation of solid earth because so many conditions of our existence are based on perceptions arising from the breath.<n><n>Mindfulness-based meditation practices make use of several breathing strategies. Through mindful awareness, we can bring our attention to the body and its various functions in order to better focus our attention on the present moment. For example, when facing a wall we can mentally visualize ourselves floating above the wall, while maintaining our breath as we turn our head to look up, and when facing a chair, we can mentally imagine the chair being filled with thoughts of God. Through this mental imagery and focus, we can bring our focus to the breath and be present in the moment, letting go of our negative thoughts and focusing fully on the present moment.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Imagine a world where life expectancy is fixed and the same for everyone at birth, yet people can engage in life expectancy "donation" – meaning that someone can extend your life three years longer at the expense of theirs. Talk about a likely scenario in this world that involves manipulated, coerced donation.<n><n>### Response:<n>		This topic is very interesting because it has potential for both positive and negative outcomes. On the one hand, we are talking about a world where everyone, no matter their age, can extend their life "by" 3 years at the expense of theirs, which is a completely voluntary choice. This projection is based on historical records and allows for immense "wisdom" to be explored before the advent of molecular biology. On the other hand, the lives of today's people would likely be significantly shortened by donation – someone could donate their organs at 46 years old to extend their life, whereas someone aged 55 years old with no meaningful functional capacity could do the exact same, hence risking their own life and limb.<n><n>However, the topic of donation has fascinating potentialities for both positive and negative impacts. On the positive side, donors could find new joy in their work with innovative companies or even find new hobbies due to the extended life potential of their donation. On the other hand the negatives include the potential for exploitation by unscrupulous health care providers, skyrocketing cost of living inflation, and loss of personal connection due to the slowing of one's life expectancy. Yet this is a topic which continues to fascinate scientists and engineers, who are working to find methods and innovative approaches to extend

What begins as a simple move--for example, 2.Nf6 or 3....e6 can quickly devolve into an 11-minute chess game. Opening suggestions for beginners include the following:<n>1. Black: Reintroduce the king as soon as possible. Black's immediate threat is the threat of falling back, which can lower the initial chess rating of even a professional. Better yet, play aggressively on this move.<n>2. White: On move two, move the king two steps back. It's common to play for e3, which could force a rook into the line, so move slowly and safely e2.<n>3. Black: Augment your initial move by advancing the rook! You want to force pawns to move to protect your king.<n>4. White: Black's kingside can developide defenses. Four knights at the castle are not ideal, but White can move his kingside forward to protect the kingside.<n>5. Black: The pawn structure needs to change as well. Two rooks and a queen can help protect the king.<n>6. White: The king needs to vacillate. If it does, the opponent can

You should choose something that will leave your body with a nice aftertaste and that will not leave you with residue.  Ideally you should choose a body wash that is made of soap that has been rinsed and then cold pressed.  After the soap has been cold pressed sodium carbonate is the most common product you will use.  This product is distilled water and will leave your body with no detectable lather.  After washing your body you must then add your product to a container of soap that has been pre-soaked in alcohol.  This will allow the soap to harden and then once it has hardened place the container of soap in a bucket of cold water and let the mixture sit in the bucket overnight.  Once the soap hardens take the container of soap and head to your local hardware store and look for items that will allow you to create a soap bar.

It’s also usually nice to have a car that can get you to and from the garage in under 20 minutes. You still may have to pay for gas and electricity, but they are usually pretty cheap.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What is the best way to invest my money?<n><n>### Response:<n>		 It depends on your goal. If your goal is to have a job, then you should choose a company that has a high probability of success. For example, companies with stellar financial records (i.e., historical returns on invested capital above 10%) include United, LifeLock, and Citi. If your goal is simply making money, then individual stocks are generally not worth the loss of diversification you would gain by investing in a large company. For example, if your goal is simply making some money, then you could generally choose to buy large short-term US treasuries, such as the 10-year treasury note. However, if your goal is to have more money rolling in the future, then an individual stock may be better suited, since large companies tend to pay dividends.

As the saying goes, no photograph is complete without a great photograph.  <n><n>The tripod and the lens are essential and belong to the photo-sensor. Without these two elements, nearly all photo-sensors suffer from picture quality.  Using the right lens and tripod for a composition can add depth and texture to the photo, but without the tripod this element lacks effectiveness.  <n><n>Processing a photograph properly could take time, but right after taking the photograph can be a wonderful experience. A smooth film stock, after being processed in a dark room or an airtight bag can enhance the quality of the photograph, despite the bit of noise it makes. Even with less processing, curling up in a ball while taking the photograph might bring out the best in you.

Because there are no regular track days in the Trans-Tahoe relay, it is a real time relay, meaning that the time between transmissions is almost always within a few hours.  The time between transmissions is important because it lets the public know when the next transmission in the series is due to occur.  The Trans-Tahoe Relay commences at 00:00 UTC on all days except public holidays.  On public holidays, it uses a repeater to transmit the message so that it is "carried-forward" through the holiday weekend to the next transmission.

More specifically, it is the replacement of a database with another database in order to improve the speed and reliability of data preparation and data analysis. Historically, databases were considered to have high reliability, at least in terms of being able to guarantee against data losses. However, since the dawn of databases, relational databases have become more capable and have become more commonly used in data preparation and data analysis, posing new challenges to maintaining high reliability.<n><n>As more and more data is transformed regularly and as more and more organizations are exposed to IT resources that have data from multiple sources, including cloud providers, Peloton, and others, it becomes increasingly important to have the ability to rapidly assess and correct for data losses. The advent of computer networks has made it possible for organizations to have more than just a single source of source data, and consequently, even the relatively small amount of data loss that occurs to a database management system can have significant implications on the organization's ability to protect its assets and the flow of information. This becomes more relevant as new data and IT resources become available and as organizations adjust to incorporate those resources. High level maintenance of databases is predominantly

The complete grappling system consists of a series of belts held by two black belt level practitioners, and commonly called "guards", which can be removed and replaced with other belts as needed to maintain the flow of the movement. Each guard is composed of a solid belt, with various colors incorporated to match the colors of the opponent, and is developed with the purpose of protecting the head and neck, and actually choking the opponent during the grappling system. The art of guard retention is crucial to success in Brazilian jiu jitsu, and is often referred to as "takedown defense", and is based around the idea of employing leverage to forcefully place the opponent under control, often locking them into a position that will require them to endure significant stress and movement in order to continue to progress to the next guard (often referred to as a guillotine choke). Guillotines are often swallowed whole or with the assistance of a guillotine choke in order to maintain control during a wrestling match. This defensive posture is known as "choking the opponent" which has been applied in MMA, and in reality-based fighting disciplines like Rickson Gracie's black

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How do you improve your basketball handles?<n><n>### Response:<n>		While every player has a unique skillset, they all share a common responsibility to improve their basketball handling. <n><n>To improve your overall basketball handling, first you must acknowledge the skill deficiency. Spend some time practicing your free throws. Effective free throws include the following: 1. Land on the targeted spot immediately following contact (ie, with your free hand at your hip) 2. Open your hips, allow for enough room to drive through the shot 3. Fall back on your free throws. This allows you to open up your body to allow for more room to drive off the ball and create space for your free throws. 4. Turn the tide by applying proper cuts once you get close to the basket. Many pros make the mistake of rotating their hips backwards when cutting through traffic to create extra movement off the dribble. 5. Over time, improve your mid-range jump shot by applying more muscle memory to its construction. The jump shot itself is a difficult exercise in itself so using the correct techniques while shooting from far away helps significantly. 6. Practice a lot of jump shots away from the basket. This will help you generate more muscle memory in the area. 7. Lastly, develop a defensive positioning too. Many times, just taking some extra defensive step away from the

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Increased money supply (i.e. money printing)<n><n>### Response:<n>		Increased money supply theoretically increases the amount of money in circulation. However, there are several problems with this claim.<n><n>First, increasing the money supply is not the best way to increase the amount of money in the economy. There must be some widespread increase in demand for money, and the increase in money supply will increase the amount of money available in the economy. This can lead to inflation.<n>Second, increasing money supply does not equal an increase in the amount of goods and services people need. Increasing money supply does not equal more money in the economy. People will still spend their daily lives exchanging money for goods and services, and an increase in money supply does not create more demand for these goods or services. Economists measure the velocity of money because the velocity of money is a proxy for the velocity of money in an economy. While velocity is a better indicator of the velocity of money than money supply, velocity alone does not equal money supply.<n><n>Third, a higher money supply does not equal increased production. Increased production does not equal increased money supply. Increased production does not mean more money is in the economy. Increased production by random individuals will not equal increased production. Growth of the economy is not a measure of increased production. Growth of an economy is a measure of

Below is an instruction that describes a task.

It will significantly lower transportation CO2 emissions over existing vehicles, significantly increasing local employment, and reducing damaging impacts on local forests, public health, and the economy. Decentralized charging infrastructure can be constructed, making it easy for consumers to charge at any time, while existing gas-powered vehicles will continue to generate revenue at current prices. Government incentives and bans on large trucks and vehicles would likely be ineffective, because many consumers won't use these vehicles and would not pay for them.Carbon-based electric vehicles produce no tailpipe emissions as they burn gasoline, significantly reducing the need to install pollution controls. Governments could further tax and regulate these vehicles to encourage investment and deployment.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What is the difference between a bass guitar and a normal guitar?`<n><n>### Response:<n>		While both guitars have their own pros and cons, there are several key differences between a bass guitar and an open guitar. The first difference is the sound. A bass guitar produces more of a "thump" than an open guitar. This is due to the thicker, heavier strings the bass guitar uses. The sound produced by a regular guitar is more of a thump with more of a "pop" to it. While a regular guitar can create more of a thump, a bass guitar can create a more "thumb pop" sound. Another difference between the two types of guitars is the pickups used. While an open guitar can be left-handed, a bass guitar must be played completely and exclusively with a dominant pick. A dominant pick is an instrument type used for playing specific diatonic chords. The type of pick used will determine how specific or broad the chords are. For instance, pick number one for a standard guitar has two narrow and two wide options. This means pick number two is the most common pick used for a bass guitar. Pick number four is generally a wide pick used for mid-range or high-end finger-style finger-style finger-crosses. Pick number five or higher for an open guitar means all four fingers are dominant.
