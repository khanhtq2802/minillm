In this inhospitable environment little time is lost once the stallor then succumbs to the exhaustion and slumber.  So the thinking behind having a mobile is that it gives the horse much more time to heal his injuries.  Do we ever say forget the old-fashioned hoarding??

Jefferson recalls the words as he discusses the duties of the new President, stating that they have been framed as 'presented to the people', 'present to them in their most direct form', and 'as sacred and inviolable'.  A quote that cops mention multiple times, with perhaps the most relevant quote being the following, 'from this day forward, we establish a system of limited government, no more, no less…for we hold these truths to be self-evident…that all power, while it is in the people, is preventable from being abused'.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What are the most common injuries in rowing?<n><n>### Input:<n>Rowing is a low-impact sport with movement only in defined ranges, so that twist and sprain injuries are rare. However, the repetitive rowing action can put strain on knee joints, the spine and the tendons of the forearm, and inflammation of these are the most common rowing injuries.[52] If one rows with poor technique, especially rowing with a curved rather than straight back, other injuries may surface, including back pains and wrist injuries. Blisters occur for almost all rowers, especially in the beginning of one's rowing career, as every stroke puts pressure on the hands, though rowing frequently tends to harden hands and generate protective calluses. Holding the oars too tightly or making adjustments to technique may cause recurring or new blisters, as it is common to feather the blade. Another common injury is getting "track bites", thin cuts on the back of one's calf or thigh caused by contact with the seat tracks at either end of the stroke.[53]<n><n>### Response:<n>		Out of the common ten most common roles and injuries in rowing, the following are the most common:<n>- Wheel: Years of rowing can develop joint and muscles injuries that are less obvious than things such as sprains and strains. It is recommended that people begin rowing with good hands to begin with. Knee and forearm are two of the most traditional joints to begin with, since many rowing races start with knees together.<n>- Lumbar: Long straight straight leg. Risk is with a horizontal barbell, so during certain loopholes in the plan, where full rotation would cause severe strains on both the lumbar and back elevation, one risks injuries. <n>- Thigh: A straight leg or core. Risk is when rowing under certain forms of technical barreling, breaking big straps which allows for quick transitions, and going over height.<n>- Shoulder: A straight barreled leg under or above shoulder may produce bigger strains on the shoulder joint.<n>- Spine: A straight barrelled shoulder joint as young individuals tend to row without a good core. It is recommended that rowing is done barefoot to begin with.<n>- Shoulder Exercises: Usually performed with a 20-30% load on the

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>write a short essay on California wild fire<n><n>### Response:<n>		California has been hit hard by our state's wildfires over the past few years, but what is still scarier is the ability of these fires to spread themselves across a state so large. Fires burn across the landscape like wildfire, spreading more quickly, and can even spread further than they originally imagined as they become scarcer and harder to control. However, the biggest problem is the infrastructure that continues to support the fire-weatherization model that most of California lives on - most infrastructure across the state is built in the 1930s, 50s, and 60s and even some buildings built in the 20th century. There are routine fuels used and ventilation systems built in at homes built like the period homes used by Calaveras County in the 1940s and the 1950s. All of this used to be available to the owners of less lucrative or historic homes. Ironically, this has been the reason that we had to rebuild spectrums for previously celebrated fires like the 1906-1909 Millburn tower fire, which burned through much of the city of Berkeley, not allowing for local residents to return to the summer months until the work was done.

Laptop computers won't have charging ports, and you'll be stuck using smartphones while hiking. Prior to getting into a vehicle, it's also critical to bring a first aid kit, along with a syringe for emergency pain management. Finally, it is always a good idea to bring an umbrella or rain jacket, in case it is particularly heavy.

Hit the ball so hard that it bounces. This is very controversial, as many consider it to be the "old" way, even though it's become less and less popular over the last decade as more and more hitters have learned to hit the ball with more power. For example, Richard Hamilton hit a grounder that bounced over the fence for a run in 2017. This bounces so hard that it breaks up a line drive by the defense, then in roughly the same period put the ball into play to end a Shin-Soo Choo double play. https://hittersoff.com/playlist/choo/<n><n>2. Throw the ball with power. Baseball is a contact sport. Any contact thrown with power by an baseman or shortstop while on base will bring a base to the plate. Some would say that when a runner begins to hit with power with a swinging bat, force an error! However, this is debatable. Should runners advance bases with a fastball we would say the passed ball seems to have less power potential and a steeper trajectory.<n><n>3. Hit blindly. Baseball appears to be a style of batting

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How should I invest my money?<n><n>### Response:<n>		There are some general guidelines that should be followed when investing. First, do your own research. Some characteristics that attract people to investing are investing in high yield bonds. Typically people prioritize their money during rich times. Rarely are assets that earn "only" 6% returns draw people to investing. What matters more is that the return on your investment is consistent across time. Second, be thoughtful about whether you want to hold or sell. Mass market investing can be challenging because with properly diversified portfolios, it is advised to hold over individual stocks and bonds. The benefit you gain is that you are able to avoid middle-manage financial institutions that interact with your portfolio one-to-one and have limited exposure to any portion of your investments. For example, most consumer staples have foreign currency conversion and may have significant fees absorbed by your foreign currency holdings. That creates uncertainty about whether you want to sell or hold your investments and it becomes difficult to manage your portfolio. Periodical closures of certain banks and brokerages often decreases overall diversification and may be required to resign income, strategy, and other assets. Finally, understand the risk of compounding of continued losses. Generally, nearly all financial market activities create virtual lumps called compounding trusts that encourage investors to buy individual shares and

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What is wine?<n><n>### Input:<n>Wine is an alcoholic drink typically made from fermented grapes. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol and carbon dioxide, releasing heat in the process. Different varieties of grapes and strains of yeasts are major factors in different styles of wine. These differences result from the complex interactions between the biochemical development of the grape, the reactions involved in fermentation, the grape's growing environment (terroir), and the wine production process. Many countries enact legal appellations intended to define styles and qualities of wine. These typically restrict the geographical origin and permitted varieties of grapes, as well as other aspects of wine production. Wines can be made by fermentation of other fruit crops such as plum, cherry, pomegranate, blueberry, currant and elderberry.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Wine is a beverage made from grapes where the fermentation process converts the sugar in grapes to alcohol and carbon dioxide for heat release.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What is the meaning of life?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Whoever says life doesn't have meaning isn't living it. Life, in its entirety, is simply the act of living, and attempting to make sense of the infinite variety of meaning it embodies is an exercise in futility. The meaning resides in the human desire to explore the world of things and beings out in the open. Surely every search yields the fruits of our labors, and the true purpose is to seek the highest good for our fellow humans. The ideology of panopticism, scientism and bureaucratic atomization stems from the desire to maximally implement oppression and enslavement. As humans become increasingly atomized and controlled through centrally controlled technologies, the notion of individual vs. collective meaning will continue to evolve. The absence of a meaning or purpose for our lives may be one of the biggest drawbacks of freedom, the lack of an identity and purpose invades our every mentality. The innate desire to find and pursue one's own happiness instills an innate drive. Woe betide any individualistic demands for perfection arising from state, industry, or bureaucracy which only serve to maintain and increase the current existence. There is much wisdom once attributed to Adam to eliminate regulation and utilitarianism: endless striving to achieve one's goals, no regrets. These quotes prove once and for all that

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Why are we like aquariums?<n><n>### Response:<n>		It's kind of sad but true. There are few things more horrid than beached at the  mouth of the river stream.  It doesn't mean that we should throw ourselves into the water as if it were our own backyard.  Water is energy too, so if we started over, we wouldn't have any other choice but to continue our life in the natural way.  There are ways of interacting with it that make it re-energize us to life in the water.  For starters, we can start taking frequent baths to cleanse our body and produce tectonic plates to dislodge old growth and graft to high reefs atoll’s volcanoes where the water is actually flowing.  Electric powered cold water machines are also very useful for cleaning the extremities of our body that would otherwise get hit by stress under the water.   They allow us to carry out manual work or versus allowing instincts to take over and act.  Digital Avatars can also be created that offer echolocation maps to friendly reefs, so now we’re able to see if they are friendly or not.  Relax, kids.  Love the process, live your life and have it work for you.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Who discovered the double-helix DNA structure?<n><n>### Response:<n>		The double helix DNA structure, also known as the double helix triple helix DNA sequence, or new DNA structure, was first discovered by Martin Marwick in 1940. DNA often consists of three or more strands linked by one or more repeats. While Marwick did not define the structure as a DNA double helix sequence, he made important discoveries that have greatly impacted the field of biology. He first noticed that long stretches of DNA were trapped between a single domain of another DNA string and later discovered that this same string sometimes presented structures that appeared oddly aligned with the nature of the DNA that the DNA strings were inserted into. Marwick suspected the double-helix structure to be an accidental creation of a primate chimera in genetics and he named the structure the Marwick loop.

Below is an instruction that describes a task.

The water absorbs all the light but refracts it a bit differently which makes it less concentrated as a lamp shade. These oceans are vast, and contain the "inner" or underlying layer of the biosphere like an onion growing in a sprout,  just below the surface so to speak.<n><n>The surface oceans result from from the convergence of numerous smaller "oceans" that are formed and built by weathering and evaporation. Oceans on earth will react with sunlight, heat and barometric pressure and the water evaporates into the atmosphere and atmosphere picks up the heat and drove that out of the water using a strong negative pressure forcing the water vapor into steam and Osmosis. The osmotic effect from the strong negative pressure has been credited with triggering the evolution of higher plant species up the biosphere and extinction of lower land species.<n><n>The other 4 oceans are the atmosphere, which is made of heavy metals from volcanos, plate tectonics, and the great model known as the Equator. The atmosphere floats through the middle atmosphere, where it mixes with and absorbs all the light.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>When rock climbing, what is the difference between lead climbing and top rope climbing?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Lead climbing is when the climber ascends a small to moderate cliff face via borrowed rope that is attached to a specially designed belay system. This belay system is engineered to work with the climber's strongest arms which allows for solo ascents and only a slight variation in load would make it unsafe.<n><n>Top rope climbing, on the other hand, increases the climbers ability to scale vertical walls, utilizing multiple athletics-like maneuvers to climb further and higher. Each successive climber faces a different wall with more and more gear. Many ascents on top rope use composite climbing prisms connected by a locking strainers used for emergency anchors. <n><n>The difference is at a chalk route that they climb using their hands, mittens and climbing straps, versus climbing a face that is chalk and bolted, some routes being repelling forces, others having "cross wind" conditions, and others having breakthroughs.

Despite its ring of hills, one experiences a vast panoramic view of the Willamette valley and the Cascade range as well as of Mt Rainier, Mt Baker, Mt Snoqualmie, the Willamette river valley, the Olympic reservoir, and the Olympic-amplified salmon fisheries. The water roads to Moses Lake only take two long detours; one for camping and one for watering the reservoir. Many singles simply drive past Mitchell Ranch Park. Seasonal rain certainly adds to the heavenly textures the lake offers. The remaining runs affixed to the surface provide solitude, the freedom to roam, bid adieu to friends and loved ones, and pitch blackness. A closer view might also reveal a thousand life-size painted walrus or mermaid sculptures (a particularly rare treat at the ferry terminal). While flathead lake lacks a tree or nature area, hiking will show participants something altogether more remarkable; a stunning hike on paved trails across stunning, marshy terrain.

Unlike tennis, when the ball hits the net in pickleball a sensation called 'hitting the ball into the net' is felt. While tennis players are primarily aiming to hit the ball over the net, pickleball players aim to get the ball to hit the basket in a proper'shot'.

How can I fix it.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Multi-threading is the use of locks in CPUs which can make your code run in a more efficient and safe manner. When the CPU locks the thread it's performing a critical operation which should result in a decrease in performance. Consider using thread pools.<n>Multi-threading can be a performance limiter. It can stop using the whole stack if critical, reducing lock levels. Tack on better garbage collection, and you should see performance improvements. If you plan to run your code in production use cases, you can reduce lock levels further by setting NOPLIMIT (Negotiate Pattern Lock) which disables multi-threading for reading and writing entirely.

The customer is most likely going to resent that. I’m happy to nap in the middle of the night if their commute is not the only thing working overtime. Third, their idea of fitting in and where they fit in is malleable. Think about the founder delusion: imagine an ideal version of yourself.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How are weather forecasts created?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Weather forecasts are generated from digital weather models and are modeled after the physics of thermodynamics. These models explain how the varying temperatures, pressure changes, and humidity all affect the flow of air and how it travels over the top of the atmosphere. These physical laws make predictions about how the weather will likely view and behave based on past data. These models are very accurate and can influence us everyday. Weather is very important for us to live and work in our daily lives as well as research studies shows that human physiology is heavily impacted by weather. When we are in the state of nature or trying to make a difficult decision like staying at home we can often rely on the models. For example, we can rely on the models when facing a water coming in too fast because the ocean can instantly change directions, leading to high waves and an overall unsafe situation. Also our brains interpret these instantaneous changes differently and attack these immediately believing it to be FAD (First Person Shooter) type of driving behavior. We see and emotionally experience these outcomes in instantaneous fashion. Others than this, models are also used in extreme weather situations. Malanodi and Alain. have also made very popular movies, "Fit", "Catch Me If You Can" and Geo through Geo. They are very well vers

When an automatic transmission (such as a manual transmission), major structural components such as axles, crankshaft, and transmission are ordered and checked to insure proper operation.  During the maintenance process, a compressed air canister is deployed from the service station to blow a small amount of fresh air into the vehicle.  Starting from the dealer's service records, a minimal cleaning is performed in regions for which the original shop records were, in actuality, altered or substituted, such as the cylinder heads and axial head bolts and bushings used on the cars.  Then a complete oil change is completed, and the 100% manual reset is performed every 12 months.  The explanation for the generations is that time can be a limiting factor, as there are no guarantees of service availability or reliability.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What is the greatest movie of all time?<n><n>### Response:<n>		For every Oscar, there is a great movie. The reason for that is that movies are supposed to be made of one person acting in a role that is similar to the essence of that person. Roger Corman, for example, had a job all his life where he acted in hundreds of movies and typically connected to those movies through his signature bracelets or shoes. His trademark was a big silver bullet and he had apple sauce. As he retired in 1993, he mentioned that he had made movies like "Man with a White Shadow". While we can't say that his movies became screen stars (racism and all those puppeteers where a part of the movie), he made Silk Spectre into one of the most famous action movies ever and Buzz saw type 2 diabetes on Star Wars. So many amazing movies can be traced to greatness through one person acting in a great role that united all of the actors in one movie. As Corman saw it, if everyone did their job, the great movie wouldn't exist.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How to calculate growth rate?<n><n>### Response:<n>		1.

Here are some simple ideas: five, ten, twenty, fifty, and ten thousand US dollars are equivalent to one US cent or thirty five cents.<n><n>All prices in furtherance of economics strive towards two sentiments: increase and decrease (price level), while changes in velocity or quantity are regarded as an absolute value of price (price momentum).

For example, ten thousand dollars of additional fresh produce will require an extra dollar of produce, ten million dollars of improvement will require an additional one million dollars, and ten thousand dollars will suffice if the us dollars are being exchanged at that rate.

The industry's seminal moment came in the mid 1950s when worldwide trends for smoother handling made repair and tune-up more readily accessible, making motorcycles an affordable alternative to the established stiff frame machines of the earlier 1950. For “performance and comfort” the brand found its best launch with the Waco model, heavily modified and extensively stripped down to fix and ride. The Waco was the highest-performance offering built and delivered in no time, bringing market and supply disruptions to several similar frames over a seven-year period – and mourning both hubcaps and chassis in some instances – making this models “legacy intrepid".<n>By 1987, motorcycles derived lesser quality from the fine cork and hard shells they had long relied on for critical handling.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What is Depreciation<n><n>### Response:<n>		In economics, depreciation is used to determine how much an item is worth, based off of historical market prices. The valuation of a currency unit (cost base) is based off of the a unit price, and this price is indexed against a specific basket of historical prices. Historically high unit prices translate into historically low depreciation. The value of an asset (i.e. a dollar spent on a cup of coffee) on the buying side, is seen as a premium over the value of the asset itself. The banks attempt to capture profit when selling currency due to the perceived value of currency. Simple math shows that you can sell high quality currency for 20% less than what it could cost you through a comparable standard bank product. A simple example implies, if I buy a new Lamborghini, my $1000 investment might end up costing the bank money if my depreciation is three times that of the purchase price. In this example, little value is added by exchanging currency while buying some currency (likes to be on buying side).

The existence of alien life form in the interstellar medium or even described By the light of the sun is generally considered to be unlikely. The existence of life as we know it today, must contain at least some trace elements that should be classified as incredible and unprecedented to us, because scientific communities have invested a great deal of effort and resources to try to understand life, life beyond earth, and life on other planets. On the other hand, if considering the odds of life, one mustachios for man. The extraordinary and verifiable fact of life among the billions in the universe alone, unless also acclaimed as a dream or fiction by the very makeup of human society, remains as extraordinary to science as were the magnetic poles of the earth at that time.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Write a brief passage arguing for mandating Electric Vehicles (EVs) over gas combustion vehicles in the United States.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Running a large battery of electric vehicles has more immediate benefits. The electric cars can increase the amount of electric vehicles on the road, because charging infrastructure is not yet mature and available in large numbers. Also, in shoring up older sustainable transportation networks, the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (pEDV) allows more people to participate in such transportation, which transfers the cost savings of EVs to drivers via lower-priced electric vehicles and permits transportation network congestion if the network is subject to a "optimal link" effect. Electric vehicles also have the advantage of not becoming stranded during periods of electricity outages, which might occur during multiple-day or sometimes multiple-hour electricity outage. Finally, all of these characteristics allow people to get home more often, where available electricity availability or availability is more flexible, making EV ownership a viable alternative to driving alternatives.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Where should I live in Indiana?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Indianapolis is surrounded on three sides by Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio. It may seem as if the city has hundreds of thousands of residents, but the number of residents is fewer than the number of downtowns and shopping districts. Big businesses, big names, and corporate headquarters once lined the streets, but you've walked right up to the aging Sears downtown without a second thought and a smile. Old buildings knocked from a bygone era are supplemented by new buildings made of shiny new material. Downtowns can still be quiet, and if you're lucky enough to have a small dog, the city has plenty to offer. People say Indianapolis, named for the oldest Col. Matthew C. Indianapolis became the 41st U.S. city in a distress of birth on April 30, 1986. The torpor of the state has wreaked havoc on the state, and Indy moans under the darkness fascinates those of us fortunate enough to live there too.

Third, the bass guitar uses a locking single-coil pickup, whereas the low-end strings on a regular guitar are pick-up strings.  A locking single-coil guitar pickup is extremely pick-up heavy, and may last as long as you play as pickups rather than using a configuration for reduction in noise efficiency.
