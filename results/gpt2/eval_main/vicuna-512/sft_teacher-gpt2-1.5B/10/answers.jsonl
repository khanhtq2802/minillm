The Maya civilization developed in the Maya Region in southeastern Mexico between the first and second millennium BC, and they were incredible builders and managers of great works of art and architecture. If the Maya civilization had never collapsed, we could be celebrating their culture's fifth century BC birthday today! The Maya civilization developed the sophisticated astronomical system known as the zenith clock, and they are equally famous for their art, architecture, mathematics, calendar, and astronomical system. The list of Maya cities that survived the collapse is quite impressive: every major city, even those that are no longer there, had a station or fortification that could have been converted to a city at some point. The Maya civilization excelled at the art of written language, and they are the first civilization to have developed written language, calligraphy, and mathematics. Their highly developed math would have made it easier for them to manage their huge empire, and also allow them to develop a more complex social structure. Without the collapse of the Maya civilization, we would still be celebrating their achievements today!"}

Smart machines are capable of performing complex operations with great accuracy, but they cannot replicate the nuances of human behavior or human motivations.

Consequences such as reduced employee productivity, increased employee discomfort, or even machine rebellion are all potential outcomes of programming too much AI.

{"text": "CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing technique that enables researchers to selectively edit specific genes within organisms. CRISPR-Cas 9 allows for precise modification of the DNA sequence of a genome, which can be used to create modified organisms with desired characteristics. The technique has been applied to a wide variety of organisms, including human cells, where it has been used to edit the DNA sequence of skin and hair cells. These edits make the cells resistant to chemicals that harm them, or develop new biological compounds that encode useful proteins.\n\nCurrently, CRISPR-Cas is used in a variety of scientific disciplines. These edits can be used to study the role of specific genes in cellular processes, the development of new drug targets, and the treatment of diseases. The potential applications of this technology have wide ranging ethical implications. For example, it has been used to modify the DNA sequence of human embryos, in order to prevent certain diseases from arising in the future. However, there are also concerns that unintended mutations may occur, and that the editing process might cause the modification of undesirable genes and leading to different diseases."}

{"text": "Although Vincent van Gogh was a celebrated artist, he would likely have remained a somewhat obscure figure had he lived to see his career peak. He was born into the Dutch Golden Age movement in the 1890s. Though he is considered a master of the visual arts, his exposure to conventional forms of art did not begin until he was later in life. As a child, he was influenced by the works of C\u00e9zanne and Le Corbusier. He was aware of and influenced by the works of previous artists such as Pablo Picasso, Frans Hals, and Marcel Duchamp. All of these artists were highly influential and had a significant impact on the development of modern art. However, Vincent van Gogh's work is noticeably different from the other artists. He was a self-taught painter, and his paintings are characterized by a vigorous use of light and shadow, complex compositions of overall colors and shapes, and a focus on close, intimate contact with the paint. Vincent van Gogh's paintings are also densely layered, with multiple layers of paint applied in irregular, jagged, and chaotic patterns. His paintings are often impressionistic in style, and they often contain something of the uncanny or absurd. This is in marked contrast to the mature, realistic paintings of"}

For example, people may choose to eat healthier when they have a lower financial situation, easier access to healthy food, and/or when they are in a healthier behavioral environment (e.g., walking, walking-based recreation, walking to work, shopping in neighborhood stores).\n\nIn terms of healthier dietary choices, knowing that ice cream is less expensive than fried chicken can help reduce the cost of eating healthy. In terms of economic situations, it may be more affordable to buy healthy foods when there are many healthier options available. Finally, in terms of health behaviors, more people may choose to smoke or not smoke based on social norms, economic situations, or their own health needs."}

{"text": "Natural selection is a process in nature that results in splitting apart and improving the traits of organisms over time. This is a great process that is at work across the planet, building and improving the abilities of organisms to survive in new and changing environments. While there are many different types of selection, they all play a role in the evolution and adaptation of organisms.\n\nOne example of natural selection is the color of a fish's eyes. The color of a fish's eye depends on a lot of factors, including the amount of light hitting the eye and how well the fish can focus its vision. The better a fish can focus its vision, the more light hits its retina, and the more colors there are to perceive. This variety of color allows the fish to be more easily seen by predators, allowing it to survive and reproduce.\n\nThere are other examples of natural selection, such as the shape and structure of nests and the hair and eye structures of birds. These same characteristics that enable birds to survive in different environments also help them to find mates and raise their young.\n\nDespite the important role that natural selection plays in the evolution and adaptationof organisms, it is not always positive. Sometimes, negative aspects of natural selection occur, such as when a completely new gene loses"}

On the environment, it is clear that using a single-use bottle results in a faster and less expensive product. However, there are also some versions of this question that try to quantify the amount of plastic usage and the resulting environmental impact. A common approach is to compare the amount of plastic used to the total amount of plastic littered globally every year. In this case, it is clear that a single-use plastic can result in more trash litter and potentially more greenhouse gas emissions. However, this comparison doesn't take into account the fact that people may reuse the plastic bottled, replacing the plastic in the bottle with something else, such as a biodiesel can, and thus further increasing the amount of plastic usage. Additionally, there are various versions of this question that consider potential human health implications, such as the potential for increased cancer risks from consuming single-use plastics or the increased risk of renal stones from consuming plastics.

This can be done through observation of social norms, for example, how people hold their coffee cups in their right hands or whether they smile more when they are speaking to you than when they are talking to someone else. Shorter conversations are also example of social norms since they often include more low level behaviors than long conversations. Another way to understand cultural differences is through observation of differences in how people behave toward one another under different circumstances. For example, when someone is suffering from a physical illness, they may tend to observe others' behavior in a less positive way. In turn, this can help others learn to cope with their illnesses in a socially acceptable way."}

High levels of government spending can be provided by increasing the budget deficit. In addition, monetary policies can be used by increasing the Federal Funds rate and decreasing the Federal Funds rate for banks. These interest rate changes will increase the cost of credit and therefore reduce economic demand and consumption."}
{"text": "I really did enjoy the movie, Gravity. Though I did feel some trepidation at the start, the story grew on me. Walton Goggins does a great job as scientist and engineer, and Michael Caine is a fine actor. The special effects were well done, and the gravity well did an excellent job of keeping us grounded. The ending shot was also quite exciting. Overall, this was a fun movie, and I could see myself watching it again."}

Here is a simple algorithm to find the highest-ranked element in the list:\n\nRandomly divide the array into two parts,  one part is the starting portion, and the other part is the ending portion. For each element in the starting portion, search the starting portion for a match, and for each element in the ending portion, search the ending portion for a match. When either of these conditions is met, then we have found the element with the highest count in either portion."}

This was a difficult decision because I loved the firm and the team but wanted to remain on good terms. After careful consideration, I have decided that best course of action is to leave on good terms. I believe that both parties can best move forward together and I hope we can remain friends.\n\nThank you for your coordination and wish me luck in the new role."}
{"text": "Music industry insiders, distributors, and talent have been speaking out against streaming platforms like Spotify, YouTube, and Apple Music for years. They argue that these platforms cherry-pick the music they play local artist and push non-traditional tunes towards the streaming platforms. In response, streaming platforms have hired music industry heavyweights like Fallen Angels and BMI to publicize their side of the story. The music industry has started to take a more official stance on streaming platforms and what is and isn't acceptable. In addition, artist reps have begun reaching out to streaming platforms to try and get their music played on the platform. However, the compromises streaming platforms have to make in order to gain the trust of the music industry and music fans is proving to be very difficult."}
{"text": "In a more general sense, the word \u200b\u201cquantum\u201d can refer to the smallest possible amount of something. In a more narrow sense, it describes a subatomic particles such as quarks or photons that interact via the weak force but only between themselves. A classical description of quantum computing refers to a single processor using quantum operations on a larger space than the size of the available physical space.\n\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing is the bit (formerly called the quantum bit or qubit). Like a classical bit, a quantum bit can exist in a superposition of its two \"basis\" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously. When measuring a quantum bit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the quantum bit in a specific way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of quantum Rules describing the behavior of quantum bits.\n\nPhysically engineering high-quality quantum bits has proven challenging. Good quantum algorithms exist but they have not been demonstrated to work reliably on large scales. The National Sciences University in Wales developed what is thought to be the best current quantum computing algorithm, called QuTech, which is secure but extremely"}

Berry would not have been forced out of the band and McCartney would not have had to leave the studio to make \"Conversations with Wolves\". The band would have continued to grow and change over the years, meaning there would have been many more Beatles songs than the originally planned 44. Also, because Lennon would have remained a member of the band through all albums, resulting in an even longer trilogy, the album titles would have remained the original plan as well."}
{"text": "Here are some considerations to keep in mind when designing an inclusive and accessibility public transportation system:\n\n1. Accessibility should be a main goal for the design of the transportation system. Transit systems that successfully integrate people with different physical capabilities have a higher probability of functioning effectively.\n2. The transportation system should be designed to appeal to as many people as possible. This means that the vehicles and seats should be designing for the majority of people regardless of their physical capabilities.\n3. The type of vehicles and routes should be designed with the ability to accommodate different capacities. For example, routes that are most commonly used by heavy vehicles should have fewer stops and destinations that are prepacked in advance.\n4. Construction of the transportation system should be fully inclusive. That is, bus stops should be located at every corner of the station, and all stations should be fully accessible."}

The most common being that people will see or read more content from brands they are familiar with, and will share that content more readily with their friends. There are also implications for the way that people perceive and treat political news. For example, people who are more politically engaged tend to be more likely to read and share primary source content from media outlets that they associate with that ideology. However, there are also implications for the type of content that people produce, and how they share it. For example, people may produce news themselves that they think is noteworthy, and which social media platforms may promote as news."}

I'm also growing up on a team of three other astronauts who are studying Mars' ecology and deciding how best to appropriately prepare for living in the future.\n\nOn Earth, I'm used to waking up at 6:00 AM and going to sleep at 10:00 PM. While on Mars, I'm awoken by the beeping of my thermometer and can only hope that the other astronauts are also ready for the challenges of living in the cold, dark, and potentially deadly radiation environment.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges of living on Mars is re-growing my own food. Earth's agriculture is based on genetically modified crops, which are susceptible to various diseases and lack the natural nutrition found in natural foods. Growing your own food on Mars requires a lot of hydroponics and automation, along with a strong automated agriculture protocol.\n\nGrowing your own food on Mars also requires a highly skilled workforce. Over the past few years, NASA has sent humans to Mars to train the new generation of astronauts, but now we're short-staffed and struggling to train everyone in the appropriate skills.

{"text": "For example, when a person is asking a question that they do not understand, it may be a good idea to explain the topic or conversation to the person to ensure they understand fully. If a person is trying to engage in a conversation and they appear to be misunderstanding something, it is possible that they are pretending to be less educated than they really are. It is also important to recognize when a person is trying to manipulate you or be dishonest. When someone is acting like they are being dishonest, it is always good to verify their authenticity by asking for clarification or providing additional context."}

Here are a few things you can try to boost your productivity:\n\n1. Set small goals: One way to work towards bigger goals is to set small, specific goals that you can continuously track towards. For example, you can write a to-do list at the end of the day to complete the tasks on your list before bedtime.\n\n2. Complete the hardest task first: In order to work smarter, you have to work harder. To increase your productivity, identify the task that is hardest for you and try to complete it first. Examples include tackling the toughest client work or the most complicated project you can find.\n\n3. Delegate: If you are part of a team, consider collaborating with team members more closely. Delegation is not about offloading work. Instead, it is about better task allocation ensuring each team member works on a task that is best suited to their skills and availability.\n\n4. Complete the minimum: In order to increase your productivity, you must first complete the tasks that are essential to get the job done. Keep to the minimum necessary tasks to ensure"}
