Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How many songs have been recorded throughout history? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.<n><n>### Response:<n>		As a historian, the universe of art presents me with many opportunities to record various cultures in chronological order, with the goal of understanding historical events and shaping mankind in the image of God. Whenever I box, I box history. And music has been a part of every human culture over time. Music as a cultural practice embodies the human creative process, informs our behavior, desires, knowledge and passions. Music also moves a tab on human-based ideas through pursuit and faith, through tipsy forks being danced, employing clever hand gestures and cultural touchstones that vibrate through the earth like woodwind instruments. Music is a universal language that addresses every aspect of human affairs through the way it is played, repeated, looped and streamed.<n><n>Complex who-made-this-song question checksindicator.com

Ultimately, however, there is no evidence that the Renaissance period existed or even that the internet existed at all.
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How can you determine if a restaurant is popular among locals or mainly attracts tourists, and why might this information be useful?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Tourists visit restaurants for a variety of reasons.  Whether it is to sample new food, experience local culture, or just see the great food.  It's also important to note that business are usually more efficient when the tourist is present.  In addition, visitors often like food presented in an aesthetically pleasing way while not being loud.  Restaurant reviews have a powerful impact on business when they are consistent across restaurants.  Similar to last point, consumption intensity is important too.  Visits from region to region can show how popular the restaurant is versus affordable.  This, in turn, can open up new menu options to cater to a larger number of visitors; if all these factors are in play then this can influence when a restaurant is offered for dining.  It can influence food prices too as locals often have tufted chairs that can be pricey.

Turing had the original high level decryption keys in 1943, but their location was lost when he was taken prisoner.  Using Enigma codes and other pieces of information made by earlier German code breakers, then to talk to each other in 1941, giving clues, lead the Allies to Germany's location in 1943, and they got the code breakers to work for Britain in 1945 using a British communications device known as a "Trench Gun".  The Allies won the war, and Turing died aged 61 in 1946 before he could be hanged.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How many snowflakes fall during a typical winter? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Snowflakes are a byproduct of the Earth's rotation. The snow on the ground gets completely heavy once the planet rotates on its axis. Oftentimes the snowflakes settle in small flake-like masses that travel along the surface, less than 1–2km in size. These flake-like shapes carry a lot of energy (rotation) that plummets into the center and draws more sunlight toward the surface.<n><n>Snowflakes generally rise by melting or sinking into relatively flat areas (in the northeast) on or near the surface. The resulting drenching layers attain their characteristic bluish appearance, often resembling those of snow flurries. It is generally only during the winter months that large amounts of snowflakes begin to emerge.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In a world where automation is becoming increasingly prevalent, is it more important to prioritize job creation or technological progress?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Despite the challenges and uncertainties previously associated with automation, technological progress is on the rise. Companies are investing heavily in robotics, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality, all of which will significantly increase the number of jobs over the coming years. Whether in physical production or in other occupations such as healthcare, employment mobility, or information operations, IT has become a large stake in society. While this trend will impact on the economy and lives, some will argue that it actually hinders jobs and destroys the middle class which requires work ethic, creativity, and sacrifice to maintain. Some will argue that it's not fair to instead complain, complain of the automation when all PIs should be focused on bringing a new product to market, building a new workplace, and expanding the use of the internet - all of which PIs are currently busy doing.

These have included the Broad Institute, Broad Institute Institute for Genome Sciences, the Broad Institute for Medical Genomics, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Programme for Integrative Genomics and Genomics (PIG), and several others. Many of these institutions have published influential articles worldwide discussing the ethics of the technology, how it can be used, and what ethical implications may arise from using the CRISPR-cas9 system in the clinic, as well as in regulated research settings or in clinical trials.<n><n>Many of these examples use a variety of tools and strategies to allow applications of the technology. These include structural modification of the DNA, creation of long sequences of a chemical mnemonic or harvester of an organism's DNA, cloning of another organism's genome, modification of the microtubule structure or a targeting molecule. Other organisms often benefit from the

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What if Vincent van Gogh had been a successful artist during his lifetime?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Van Gogh never met his artist contemporaries as he spent most of his life immersed in the Netherlands, the oil boom and the Second World War. Unlike many artists who spent their lives adrift, van Gogh lived a productive life as a technical engineer and leading figure in the Dutch communist movement. He became known internationally with his macabre and attention to detail paintings of ordinary people. Although van Gogh grew up in a poor home in Ghent, he was exposed to the artistic culture in the Netherlands via visiting his contemporaries, including Rembrandt, Walter Gropius and Claude Monet.<n><n>In 1937, he married Stacey van Gogh, his art teacher. Although they divorced in 1940, they lived a quiet life after the Second World War, spending most of their time in Stockholm as a teenager. In 1946, he painted the abode of the gothic Flemish painter Raphael, whom he had loved since childhood. Van Gogh exhibited his work extensively including during the Flemish International Exposition of 1947, and the enigmatic "Opus" of 1948, all of which had major success. van Gogh was widely criticized for his appearance at this period, notably by the Catholic Church. Finally, his interest in photography and the expressive medium were

If we had the resources, we could solve the problem of global warming right now - it is the biggest threat to our planet. In reality, space exploration presents many more challenges. The Earth is only 7% of its present size from the impact of the dinosaurs and the early humans. <n><n>However, by re-establishing hope and scientific innovation, we could show the rest of the world that innovation and exploration are not mutually exclusive. Throughout the cosmos, we can start with a new pride that allows us to invest more into the future of our planet and the future of life on Earth.
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How many lightning strikes occur on Earth each day? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Lightning occurs on Earth every 365 days. As the planet rotates on its axis, it experiences a rotation period. During this revolution, the size of the planet changes and its poles move further out from the equator. These additional parameters will cause the Earth to experience greater lift, with the result that the surface of the planet is farther from its equator. This closer proximity causes more of the same destructive winds which the equator experiences. The intense and fast rotation in these fast rotating objects cause the most powerful storms. Thunderstorms, torrential rain, tornados and extremely destructive hurricanes are all all outcomes of a storm. <n><n>Lightning also happens in the sky. Born of the pressure difference between the black hole and its companion neutron star in the galaxy NGC 4474, hydrogen gas ejected into the central magnet shows an intense rotation. While magnetization differs significantly from other ways in which light is emitted, this process continues to produce photons on the order of 10-15 metres across. It takes these flashes of light, along with the intense solar winds, which attract the gas away without and cause very high speeds at the light end, as the particles decay into photons.

Hawaii is richly known for its waxing and waning crows nesting on top of old island huts. Hanae Court is where the famous Polynesian Kakahele statues are located.<n><n>Even as one reads these twentieth-century notions, visiting Waikiki at night would evoke images of icebergs breaking from the ice, reverence in temples, predatory birds with beaks the size of handguns and braying geese carrying the feathers of gibbons and other bird species. The Polynesian Cultural Center and Polynesian Hotel are excellent choices for a Polynesia-centric tour through Hawaii.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How do cultural, social, and economic factors influence people's food choices, and how can this knowledge be used to promote healthier diets?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Policy implications<n>Changing dietary patterns for health is particularly challenging: one pound of fat can significantly impact your caloric intake and can render you obese. Additionally, there are many environmental factors which can reduce or increase people's natural diets and consequently their nutrient intake.Most food choices we make, whether we like it or not, shape society. Foods are part of who we are and belong to us. If we break the cycle of eating, often creating long term ill effects, we need to recognize and seek help from others to change as well. Dietary choices should vary based on the activity or activity level of the individual. And it's even more important to understand a diversity of nutrient requirements for the individual and other factors such as the quantity of calories produced and consumed so that we can optimize nutrient rich diets that work for various macronutrients.In conclusion, economic, social, and health factors play a role in people's foods choices. Reducing intake of processed foods can help promote healthier diets. Policy changes should promote more diverse nutrient diets so as to create a lower incidence of obesity in the future.

However, thanks to your cunning, I will not go that far. Instead, I will propose a more spectacular theory, with more dramatic outcomes.<n><n>By reflecting upon the nature of our endeavor, human beings have valuable insight into Nature's beauty. It has been said that the writer is the sun: words to sum up the beauty of the universe. Yet, my bucolic childhood dreams come true. My first primary school years coincided with an adolescent rebellion. Books were banned at school to absorb our desires and seek distraction. Although the desire to fight hurt our morals, it resulted in our teenage rebellion. My mother had brought home one of my siblings, but she refused to let me read The God of Small Things with her, as it disagreed with many things we considered immoral: from participation to using the resources assigned to us for spiritual growth and personal development. This paradigm shift scared me. My occasional benefits were yet another temptress. I wished a child to hearken back to the able spending, more impulsive spending which resulted in us gathering more money. For example, at Christmas the store manager would give out boxes of Christmas trees and other stocking stuffers

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Why might someone choose to use a paper map or ask for directions instead of relying on a GPS device or smartphone app?<n><n>### Response:<n>		The person will want to clear their head first before using a map or directions. Using a map will let the person interpret the physical surroundings based on historical data without relying on historical data. The person will never physically trace locations on a map, but if they do they still need to use the map to orient themselves. This is because distances have varying shapes, and the physical structures of the map can flatten things out even further, making it harder to trace a difficult-to-predict route. The majority of it is though, relying on other sources to get directions/map results in wasted time, distance, and data. The person may also want to do this for safety! They may have a child running with them in case something happens to them, only to find a bear nearby in their neighborhood! This would need to be verified via their phone or GPS.

On average, students today use seven hours of their remaining free time per week to study, while decades ago one’d spent nearly two hours per week on average. As our population ages, schools continue to bear the burden of teacher shortages and financially strapped students attempt to “slack off a pricey book in the car”, only to find their efforts met by paltry pocketbooks.<n><n>Standardization of curriculum among institutions has been controversial, always results in students watching multiple widely accepted “worksheets” which groups of topics all students can study. Groups of subjects can then focus on which areas of the curriculum are “proven” to have the largest effects: groupings of facts, numbers, and reasoning outcomes have performed great magic in supporting human progress and technological developments, supporting our ability to survive, communicate, collaborate, invent, hunt, manipulate, overthrow, and build. By comparison, diverse subjects, evolution, mathematics, parallel universes, arbiters, and timelines are  often weighted in favor of result-oriented subjects.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Implement a queue data structure using two stacks in Python.<n><n>### Response:<n>		data structures like lists and dictionaries are easy to work with and are a good candidate for a queues data structure. For our example, we first create a list of tuples with keys and then a single dict that contains all tuples in the list as keys. Next, we create a dict of integers from 0 through n and increment the keys using the dict procedure. Finally, we create a dict whose elements are the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 and list all items (so the total length of our list is n).<n><n>List-like structures like dictionaries and tuples in Python are also a good candidate for a queued data structure. In our case we create a list of dicts and then create tuples for each dict dict row and append these tuples to rows. The total number of tuples is 1, 2, 3 and 4 and each dict row belongs to a tuple in the list. Finally, we add row-major tuples to each dict tuple to produce the total number of tuples.<n><n>In summary, a queues data structure works by first creating a list with keys and then delving into nested-pairs of tuples to get maximum sorted results. The nesting order matters and is

Not so long ago, there were fears that virus-carrying rodents could spread the virus as well, but this has since been refuted.<n><n>Another aspect of immunity comes from the role played by the CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing technology revolutionized gene editing. Previously, genes that regulated infectious disease response were found at the crucial loci where virus infections originated. Now, sites with virus genomes were wiped out. Note, however, that this approach does not eliminate genetic variation within a virus, nor does it expand the viral genome significantly.<n><n>Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of BLAST library sequencing of virus RNA produced by enzyme-based platforms can offer a unique window onto how genetic variants interact with conjugated linole
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Why do some people enjoy the sensation of being scared, such as by watching horror movies or going on roller coasters, while others avoid these experiences?<n><n>### Response:<n>		It is always best to consult a medical professional before deciding to experience extreme fear or discomfort. If the discomfort worsens, one should consult a physician. It is also encouraged to talk to friends or family, who might be able to provide advice. Focusing primarily on the short-term outcomes such as anxiety can mask many of the root causes, which can lead to feeling trapped, stress or depression. For example, some people flinch away from situations they might be fearful of, fearful of, fearful of something resembling a knife, rash or deadly disease, out of instinct. This type of self-medication can help alleviate fear and anxiety, but it often creates symptoms which cannot be adequately diagnosed and managed.

This is a total of 87.33 trillion times. When looking at a light beam 30 times, our retinas can take in 8 billion joules of light. If we do a comparison in photovoltaics, we can see that our eyes perceive light as having the same frequency as light of one milliwatt, and ten times more energy. Therefore, compared with the principles of quantum mechanics, it is easily explained by the simple fact that our eyes perceive three different wavelengths of light.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What if the Black Death had not occurred in the 14th century?<n><n>### Response:<n>		There are many historical reasons why it is unlikely that the Black Death caused the demise of the Roman Empire. These include one, the Roman military was incapable of fighting the Black Death and was thus largely left to the Ottoman Empire to address. Another reason is that speculation abounded after the pandemic of the Black Death about whether certain people had contracted the disease and spread it to others led to reckless speculation. Lastly, the massive organisation of ordinances criminalising the transmission of the disease forced poorer individuals to carry the risk, wasting the collective resources of the Empire further.

Treasure Hunt. It starts off with hope and then the treasure hunt never ends once you have it. Prepare for any eventualities that may confront you during the treasure hunt. Our motto should be pure hope, but also be build with deep questions balanced with humility. Treasure is something you can always find, yet will never know, treasure is what brought you to this planet to start this whole journey.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>What are some potential implications of using a single-use plastic bottle versus a reusable bottle on both the environment and human health?<n><n>### Response:<n>		1. The use of plastic or polyester bottled beverages is a major contributor to the emission of toxic chemicals such as paint, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), acetic acid, carbon dioxide, etc. which attack the DNA of the evolving organisms in our ecosystem and therefor have exponentially increased the likelihood of us ingesting this plastic waste which has to be eliminated through biodegradation process.<n>2. Plastic contains certain pesticides which have been shown to causing neuro-developmental and behavioral disorders.<n>3. Use of plastic grocery bags and donations is a source of many poisoning caused hazards for our children and that have been linked by scientists to inhaling toxic chemicals released by village re-fineries.

Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.<n><n>### Response:<n>		It takes approximately one Earth rotation period (about 687 million years) to completely rotate the planet. The basic equation is:<n><n>1. <n>- Rotating Planet is orbiting the Sun at a distance of about 10,902 kilometers, <n>- The complete rotation period is 183 million years<n><n>Note that you must not assume that the planet is pulling the other planets around. For example, if Cappadocia orbits the Sun at 60 degrees per day, the other planets slightly orbit around it. The calculations show that every 4 Earths produces a new rotation and all are equally pulled by the Sun.

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How can observing the behavior of other people in a social situation provide clues about cultural norms and expectations?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Observing others intentionally can provide clues about expectations and cultural norms. For example, observing infants, toddlers and young children can be a positive or negative example of infant-directed observing. Although infant-directed observation is frowned upon by society, it can provide information about expectations and economic status. For example, observing children who appear upset and cry could be a predictor of infant-directed emotion. In addition to observing children who appear upset, it could also be associated with missing opportunities for growth and a lack of discipline. Finally, observing children who are taking time to sit quietly and look away is a sign of intimacy. For example, observing a child who takes a "selfie" might indicate that they are "lazy or isolated," having no social circle or that they "have their own space to explore." Thus, observing other children passively or walking in their shoes or motioned to pass space between themselves and others can provide clues about typical behavior.

The atmospheric music rises above the harmonic background, and the orchestra imparts many emotions.<n>The ensemble is well-recited, and brings to the stage a fierce energy. Several beautiful and whimsical compositions are interspersed throughout the performances. The music is unrestrained and often repetitive. It's thrilling to witness a large orchestra in action, and the ambiance just adds to the fun. This is a must-see in Madrid!<n><n>The opera, which is about to start, is one of my favorites. I'm not sure I've ever seen an opera before that was this impressive, and does a remarkable job of conveying its fantastic themes. The building lit up with such brilliant sunlight, and I wish someone had filmed this scene in glorious HD!<n><n>The Beatles were a big influence for me on this concert, because the rhythms and harmonies they elucidate are timeless. I'm generally a fan of their music—especially the prolonged introductory movement, which conveys the atmosphere; orchestral instruments thunderously revving through the multiple octaves, and feeling so natural. I also think they applied a healthy dose of pop culture jokes in their music, as

How would you describe your signature dish to a panel of judges?<n><n>### Response:<n>		My signature dish would be to create delicious, thoughtful food from ingredients you've got on hand. To prepare this delicious food, you would start by preparing a lobster roll, which is a warm lobster with a light tomato sauce sauce, a creamy mozzarella cheese, okra paste, aromatic horseradish, and horseradish infused olive oil (don't forget to include some dill and celery!). Next, produce a beautifully stemmed alfredo and strum the strings behind the big old head of pumpkins with bittersweet coriander (a super classic springtime fruit!). Boil the pasta and surround that with hearty, house-cured black beans, which are shared among the luffa desert tortillas (my dutch oven!) next. With a swig from the fizz, simmer the brownie layer and melt 500 grams of butter! Next, duh! Toast and enjoy!
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Why might someone prefer to shop at a small, locally-owned business instead of a large chain store, even if the prices are higher?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Smaller shop owners can focus on improvement, smaller inventory, and faster delivery, all of which are frequently the best qualities when compared to the high, double-digit price tags associated with larger chain stores.  The convenience of a small shop allows consumers to focus on the quality of the goods rather than the price tag, which also reduces their need to return to purchase during store closing hours or other deadlines, when there are fewer people in the store.
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How many text messages are sent globally in a minute? Try to explain your answer. Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.<n><n>### Response:<n>		According to Guinness World Records, in 2011 228 million text messages were sent globally. 101% of them were from a single country to other countries, the entire recipient countries. This includes both outgoing and outgoing text messages, between and within mobile phone networks and traditional landline telephones as well as landline telephones used in public libraries, banks, and CCTV cameras.<n><n>However, disregarding geography, most of the text messages sent in a minute are also outgoing and contain the combination of lead and other technical data. In other words, 99% of the outgoing text messages contain the leading zero characters as well as the number one, two and five, the five-character codes in the English alphabet.<n><n><n>Logically, if you delete 0% of the outgoing SMS text messages, it takes 99% of the outgoing SMS messages and reduces the total amount of outgoing content to 0% of the outgoing content completely. To maintain 99% of outgoing content, you need to delete the leading 0 characters. That unfortunately requires about 270 bytes and there are multiple formats that can achieve this.<n><n>We can define our second assumption succinctly. Most outgoing SMS messages have SPF-32 or better yet “SPV” field with some involving keys and fields. There are

Your explanation should take the reader through your reasoning step-by-step.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Words are made of particles called syllables, made up of two or more consonants, vowels, and tones. Words that contain 2 syllables or more are called  syllables.<n><n>Let's imagine we have written this sentence:<n><n>Lucy in a carriage day.<n><n>That is the correct sentence, but is missing the word Lucy. As a matter of fact, the word Lucy is made up of three syllables:<n>- St. Lucy who was buried  near the valley.<n>- St. George who lived beside Lucy to whom she belonged.<n>- And the word Sa is also a simple word and must be added in.<n><n>In the system of mind in which we have been employed so far using simple words sporting  simple meanings, it does not make sense that we should mention the next word even though for what purpose?<n><n>So the following can't be the correct sentence even though it would make sense that Lucy and Sa would mention her.<n><n>That leaves this:<n>Lucy can't talk.<n>Sawing out a mirror.<n><n>Lucy can't drive.
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How can governments utilize fiscal and monetary policies to combat economic recessions?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Policy responses to recessions are generally based on macroeconomic theories that explain the dynamics of a financial system and how the society will respond to changes in the monetary or fiscal policy stance of the central bank.<n><n>Common macroeconomic theories that are used to explain economic recessions often revolve around two general themes: initial velocity.  This is the deceleration in velocity of economic activity following a recession, and it is explained as shown in the following animation:  <n><n>A recession originating in the year 2007-2008 will cause a maximum velocity decline of 2.0% over the six-year period 6 = (A/B)2 = (S/C), where S is the velocity of economic activity at the time of the recession, and B is the velocity of the prior year's inflation rate.  Factors that cause this velocity decline include a contraction in nominal wage growth, which causes wage inflation; a decline in corporate profits following a contraction in spending following a sharp decline in energy prices; and a mortgage crisis which result in an increase in interest rates and hence reduces consumer demand leading to rumors of bank failures.

Produced by Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight Trilogy) and directed by Christopher Nolan (Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens), this futuristic take on the novel space opera directed by George Lucas (Indiana Jones and The Last of Us) is a shocker that will be talked bout for decades."<n><n>I don't think anyone can deny how important the special effects and visuals of the film are. Especially considering the budget and scope of the movie. A few of the special effects shots are from movies like The Dark Knight and The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, with much more expended budget and second thoughts.<n><n>The most impressive special effects sequences were inspired by the idea of a dying star. The idea started with a "doomed star" being sent to a black hole, and its gravity was described by images from Hubble. Here are three examples of images Hubble provided (source: https://hubble.sts.com/hubble/2016/11/19/star-of-doom.html, https://hubble.st/hubble/2016/, and here are images from several different

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Solve for x in the equation 3x + 10 = 5(x - 2).<n><n>### Response:<n>		x is positive, so we know for sure that x must be greater than 5 in this case. Find the square of that fact: square * 2 * 4 == 5, which is 1. We know for sure that for any positive integer x greater than 5, that number must be positive. Therefore, we have sqrt * x - 2 * 4 = 5, which is true.
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Implement a binary search algorithm to find a specific element in a sorted array.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Binaries search algorithms typically use the order in which elements are listed in order to perform the search. For example, for a sorted array of integers, the order in which the numbers are listed in the outer product is key. In a binary search, this is done using the start of each element in the sorted array followed by the index, typically 3 (positive integer) followed by a colon as the index, and a count (negative integer) followed by a count. Each element in the sorted array is then classified into its component parts using the same method. For example, 2 is part of an int array, and 3 is part of an int32 array, so we could compute the total number of elements as "{layer-1 : int[][][index]}", 4, 5, 6, 7, 8[][index] + layer-1 + layer-2 + layer-3 +...

Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Pretend to be a character in a post-apocalyptic world. Describe how you survive and the allies you encounter.<n><n>### Response:<n>		In a post-apocalyptic, post-tech world, humans struggle to survive.  Most people would consider themselves fortunate, really, but every human has a limited resource pool, and so does each other.  The most ardent and resourceful among the population must find values that no one else can perceive. Furthermore, help from others requires both the willingness to blindly join someone else's struggle at a high level, and a measure of risk tolerance. So almost every human is probably experiencing this soon enough as society is grinding to a halt.  It's hard to be resourceful against all odds and vulnerable to the uncontrollable whims of fate.  Fortunately, humans are resilient and crafty, and alliances during times of drought or famine will often be formed by donations from families who have survived or are suffering from drought (and their resources, where available, are insufficient).  Join a scavenger hunt and counterfeit government documents, search for measureable items, manufacture an arsenal of heavy weapons or high-tech items in the open air, invent devices that work without any human involvement (or a use of a need to adhere to technology), and become unkillable in battle.  You will sell these items for a price, and when needed, join forces with other people coming to

Describe your emotions and the view from the top.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Mount Everest is a enormous mountain peak at 14,848 feet.  I was prepared for what was to be my toughest challenge yet.  Everest has some of the steepest and most dangerous terrain on Earth. To climb Mount Everest, you would need a very specific precision- crafted equipment, management of skills that would be virtually impossible to someone new to mountaineering.  The Himalayan mountain range is relatively dry land, encircling millions of square miles of arable land.  When we climbed Mount Everest, we were prepared to endure a catastrophic event that involved uncontrolled avalanches, crushing avalanches, and a mountain goat that was vastly larger than any of us.  Everest contains no border between the highest and lowest areas, so all of the equipment and supplies needed to climb Everest would be a highly variable supply chain.  Without dangerous weather, the supplies would have to be augmented with digital mapping which would be very difficult for us to access immediately.  It would take days throughout the expedition to understand how far we were actually from any different point on Everest, using the global positioning system (GPS) to get the exact location and age to ourselves as well as use our own own GPS coordinates to build our descent route and techniques uniquely suited to our circumstances.

Classical computers use bits to represent information, representing the bits of information these computers might search for, with each bit representing a different operation which is possible.  During the calculation or calculation the electron passes through many paths and the available paths spend some time respectively producing its result.  Paths include spin-up, spin-down and side-chaining.  If all of the paths produced the same result the team responsible for the successful calculation get to keep the total amount of money at the end of the calculation.  Some people call these quantum computers known quantum computers.

The "Y" is the starting "f" in the alphabet, part of the letters of the alphabet to make it sound like "four," and has become synonymous with creativity and the idea of forming a small band. The creation of the Beatles as a group means understanding the nature of the initial idea and how it was formed, as opposed to considering it as a band with a specific name.

These elements include a dedicated bus lane, toll lane, shared ride carpool, and universal ticketing systems. Wireless connectivity is also essential; it is able to send and receive information from any source that is compatible with the devices that these networks support. It also helps user groups to create an interactive map, with gestures, that can be used to motivate them to take the initiative in designing a system.<n>All these elements and more are found in an inclusive public transportation system.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How do language and cultural barriers affect the way people communicate and form relationships in multicultural societies?<n><n>### Response:<n>		In highly industrialized societies, the predominant language and the behavior and ethics of individuals have been influenced by the language, culture, and socialization. Language has become one of the principal means of conveying ideas, sharing experiences, creating and sharing knowledge, and establishing social ties.<n><n>Language and culture also have a direct impact on how individuals form relationships in diverse societies. One adapts to their surroundings, learning from others, exchanging ideas and exchanging knowledge, and establishing strong social ties. In this way, language and cultural barriers completely destroy the functional nature of such relationships.<n><n>Language and socialization are not static. Changing social norms create fresh and complex patterns of behavior and behaviors. Language and behavior change through cultural transmission, as a large number of individuals influence their immediate environment through their communication of ideas, practices, ideas acquired, opinions and behaviors. Even the simplest behavior, such as walking down the street, is influenced by the social categorizations of physical space and people and the meanings attached to these categorizations, to a large extent. Furthermore, small influences can have a significant influence on very complex patterns if social communication has not yet developed sufficiently, especially between different groups (e.g., between children and adults). Several regression models show that the fundamental connection between human pair bonding relies

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How do social media platforms influence the way people consume and share news, and what are the potential implications for the spread of misinformation?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Social media platforms impact news consumption in myriad ways. The first reason we consume news on social media is to get input on what is actually happening, or don't like, or make up facts about what is happening to society as a whole. This title driven consumption means that we don’t actually have time to actually read each article posted on a platform, and err on the side of exaggeration and exaggeration, relative to what is factually accurate and in the public interest. This is especially helpful to propagandize pieces of information in pedagogy, where students need to take cues from,"I told you so" or "I told you so because you “re “moving that party” “out of the way”  always is URL shortener for “you”. Hence “You” content is “lectured” academically and socially, and how society perceives and evaluates “lies” becomes paramount in marketing (it deals with perception, not facts itself), based at a young age. From there, it simply grows exponentially across all media sources from television to mobile phone to social media, where it becomes ripe for sharing and entertainment for everyone for many years. This is the “generation”

I have grown up on Earth, but has quite different needs to me. Most importantly, I love the food, people, and artwork that I see on Mars.<n><n>Mars has harsh climate and a desert landscape that smells like sulfur. It also lacks life, but, because Mars was the first place humans went to explore, it has resources to learn about life outside of Earth.

My favorite tip for people attempting to understand complex topics if they are very new to the world of psychology is to be entirely honest and skeptical about their ability to grasp what is being said in context.  Accept the intuitive intuition that others might interpret differently, but do not let that get in the way of your ability to make educated judgements.  Remember, your questioning and skepticism are not just valid but beneficial, because they help you form an educated understanding of what is being said and are used as scenarios or models for analysis on another person's perspective, based on preexisting assumptions.

The details that make up a story are often complex and subjective so it is difficult to evaluate someone's credibility solely based on their statements, however, there are several bias factors that can be considered such as: structural issues in the article or blog that can impact the credibility of the individual or group of individuals making the statements making them up as facts or opinions, voice-over, grammar and/or punctuation errors, and word choice which tends to artificially inflate the importance of a kernel or foundation of facts that can be anecdotal in nature, which can lead someone to assume that some statement is fact. Based on the inherent biases in the sourcing of information, you will generally, but not always, find this information reliable.
Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>How can I increase my productivity while working from home?<n><n>### Response:<n>		Working from home often leads to distraction and burnout, and it's important to address these in order to remain productive. Here are a few ideas to help you keep your mind and body engaged:<n><n>1. Create a daily working commute. This can come in the form of a 20 minute drive to or from work. Create a little one hour block around your workday, and get some rest each day. Then, you can focus off of the distractions by organizing tasks that require less time. For example, if you encounter problems with translation, try taking on additional duties or tasks that conflict with translation. For example, if your sole task is to engage the local community to identify and support a reliable Chinese restaurant location, then engage that Chinese community to determine which such location is suitable for the job and which activity it will support. Form a task delegation with a friend or family member to ensure that everyone receives at least some help participating. In addition to individual tasks, family member assigns tasks such as double ballet choreography, and then assigns additional choreography for you to perform.<n><n>2. Plan a time for rest. Have an organized and time-bound rest time.  Rest may mean a nap or a golf tournament. Try to establish a time initially in the morning

Artificial Intelligence (AI), a branch of Artificial Intelligence (artificial) intelligence, could revolutionize this aspect of healthcare delivery.<n>I would describe to you a scenario where Artificial Intelligence, a branch of Artificial Intelligence, could be used to provide better service to all parts of the healthcare system, enabling all users to be fully informed and empowered. AI can be used as the technical advisor on patient charts, scheduling of tests, diagnoses, and prognosis, assisting with expert opinions during the development of drug development, assisting in the design of AI medtech solutions, and enabling the provision of the most reliable, safest, and most efficient healthcare service. AI has the capabilities to perform these various tasks, providing positive results that will significantly improve health outcomes, reducing unnecessary delays and churning out better-quality care.
