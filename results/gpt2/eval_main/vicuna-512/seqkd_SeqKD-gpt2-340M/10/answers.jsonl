The Fuhrer took a gamble then to imprison and dismembered Turing, giving him a sense of moral responsibility and giving him a chance to discover crucial words, phrases and pieces of code that aided in the destruction of the Second World War.\nTo escape the Fuhrer, Turing suggested that he may have unwittingly aided in World War II by simply possessing and using the code for the Enigma, twenty times. At his sentencing, Judge Advocate General Fulton Piggott asked Turing, \"Are you satisfied there was no serious offence?\" \"Yes, ma'am\", replied Turing.

{"text": "A typical winter storm has winds from the northeast blowing 80\u201390 miles per hour, which moves completely over the top of the mountains and creates a huge amount of snow. This creates slush, which falls. Slush increases over the mountains, and the less snow falling, the less slippery the roads become. Hence, more snowflakes fall. According to science, it takes about 7.5 inches (20 cm) of snow for a large area of the US to get 1 inch of snow this winter. This amount of snow will fall during a typical winter storm, with each snowflake contributing 10 to 30 pounds (7.5 - 8 kg) of snow to the ground and causing at least one human fatality.\n\nHow many snowflake does your country get each year?

The Maya civilization was one of only a few globally significant ancient civilizations, and its demise gave rise to a new set of environmental challenges, including a dominant farming culture rather than hunter-gatherer lifestyles. Some have attributed the Maya's demise to climatic shocks, such as El Ni\u00f1o rather than global warming, but the authors of both studies offer new scenarios, arguing that early humans might have contributed to the Maya's demise by influencing climate, which in turn triggered the Maya's demise.\nSome anthropologists remain convinced that two separate but related events -- the Maya civilization's collapse and global warming-- contributed to the extinction of the Maya civilization.\nOne theory studies the demise of the Maya civilization as biotic in which vulnerable, nomadic hunter-gatherers eliminated a critical source of food while simultaneously driving subsequent agricultural populations toward more productive, urban lifestyles.

Sounds good in itself, but what if the recipient doesn't quickly understand this new word or doesn't understand the context? This can become an issue for an automated system. Our solution is to generate a new word according to some dictionaries and understand the context before sending the text to the recipient. We can then use the word translation features on our keyboard to search for similar phrases in websites and instant messaging applications.\nThe first task is to plot one of the words we generate or use to translate using dictionaries and instant messaging applications. We need to use free tools such as Wordle to find so called long-hand equivalents to science words. The meaning of these words might differ globally, so we need to make sure we understand their context used when translating them. Then we can search for similar phrases in textbooks or online to choose the correct one. Once we have both long-hand and free equivalents, we can draw Our own long-hand equivalent by entering \"wikipedia\" into Wordle, \"colombia\" in Google search engine, or \"lawfare\" into Apple dictionary.

{"text": "Policy responses to economic downturns generally include central bank interventions like quantitative easing, interest rate cuts and asset purchases to alter economic expectations and economic data.  This helps stem the flow of savings and capital outflows into alternative asset classes instead of investing in productive assets like housing.  Monetary policy at the Federal government level also includes regulatory action like the creation of clearinghouses and liquidity requirements to help establish and track the accounting rules for securities transactions.  Additionally, individual state and local governments often enact tax cuts and spending to offset the associated increase in their state and local government tax burden.  Additionally, individual and business owners often adjust their calendar year production of goods or services due to cyclical economic conditions.  Finally, individual and business owners can leverage technology, including cloud computing and information technology, to reduce their tax bill.  When prudent individuals, businesses, and consumers begin reaping the benefits of economic activity, their government will have fostered a virtuous cycle of economic growth, tax cuts, technology investments and innovation, and earnings for all Americans."}

When the count reaches zero, remove the element from the element starting at the given position. Otherwise, return the null element recursively.\n\nIf the starting position is invalid (i.e., count is zero), then if the count is less than or equal to the length of elements, write an error message and abort the algorithm, else, return the element at the given count.\n\nIf the length of the element to be inserted is less than the count, then error checking if the element is itself in the sorted array results in manual adjustment.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a sorted array with n elements of length 2: The following code changes length from 2 to 1:\nStarting position: n - 1\nLength: 2\nCount: 2\n after listing all the elements starting from the first (from \"\" to \"\"), removing elements starting with the first or id, adding elements starting with the second or same id ("}

{"text": "A quantum computer is an artificial intelligence supercomputing device capable of performing calculations by exploiting the properties of quantum bits (qubits). These qubits can communicate with each other via the quantum tunnel, each bit representing a unique random number. For example, a single qubit can be used by many different processors and the available computing power is widely used for scientific computing. \n\nA computer scientists working on the design of quantum computers need to first understand how to set up and operate a natural language model (NML), and then use existing algorithms and data theory to study basic mathematical phenomena. NML models are generally seen as baseline technology in quantum computing, along side algorithms for measuring and representing quantum bits and solving problems. In addition, each human programmer must establish their own NML model for their preferred operation and behavior, often using traditional Microsoft CAD or Java spreadsheet programs. Others learn how to program with pre-defined programs from a well known mainstream programming language (such as Fortran or Fortran 98) and the various general-purpose programming languages (such as Python or Matlab), which help quickly see what is algorithm, program and what is expected behavior. Finally, one learns basic sign language and post hoc reasoning before attempting to design a program for achieving state-of-the"}

Released three decades apart, each album captures the unique, adventurous spirit of its predecessors at a vital moment in its creative journey. Yet, this isn't the industry they became famous in. The essence of their music formed for them only three years apart and the repetitive nature of their schedule inevitably made it hard for them to maintain their momentum over lengthy periods of time. So despite the creative similarities, the creative flexibility of the band wasn't the source of their success. They simply needed to find a way to collaborate."}

In other words, people learn how to communicate more easily, independently, and with more frequency if they learned how to communicate in a non-mixed manner.\nIf non-mixed communication is the default, the children of people with mixed languages/culture do end up being'mixed' themselves, as in immigrants who have the ability to read and write German and English as well as French and Italian. On the other hand, parents who adopt the non-mixed communication model, do not also adopt the immigrant's / their cultural roots, but the established inter-cultural norms of respecting differences and building partnerships through respectful language, customs, and norms. Future generations of immigrants from more diverse cultures may not necessarily come to see the world as being the same, but this energy of multiculturalism can reduce conflict and allow people to be more open-minded and willing to experiment in different cultural styles."}
{"text": "Social media platforms impact news consumption in many ways. The rapid spread of information via social media platforms promotes aggregation and sharing. This enables internet and mobile users to learn about, or search for, news they may have missed. These users can then spread these information across multiple platforms. The success of this type of aggregation may ultimately result in misinformants consuming media for errrant reasons or simply due to their work habits. Additionally, the discovery of new perspectives when reading news from others and other individuals may drive information sharing. This may in turn lead to more users sharing information about issues or topics in news stories. The success of these sources may lead to media and monetary connections for news outlets. The large amount of material reached internet users over a short period of time is what fosters a phenomenon known as \"fake news\". This in turn leads to content being spread which can appear as fact for others who may not necessarily know these facts. These concepts help to spread misinformants information, which ultimately leads to the spread of misinformation itself."}

{"text": "Currently, the primary high-level goal in healthcare is delivery efficiency, meaning achieving the outcomes of care which are most efficiently achieved while reducing or eliminating unnecessary interventions. A key driver of efficient care is delivering high-quality care at the lowest cost, which is largely accomplished through the use of data and analytics. Yet, with existing systems and techniques that perform basic tasks efficiently (e.g., diagnosing, treating, and alerting patients), it is difficult to achieve the targeted outcomes. One of common uses for artificial intelligence (AI) such as deep learning and Watson is as the capabilities to perform classification and pattern recognition tasks, which help improve accessibility to the best care at the lowest cost.\n\nArtificial intelligence can be used to assist with addressing this problem, helping to identify and diagnose the most likely sources of issues at high utilization, which can then be addressed. In addition, close monitoring of medical records, patient outcomes, therapeutic interventions and patterns of outcomes can be leveraged, which enables the system to identify patterns of illness and be more accurate in its performance.
