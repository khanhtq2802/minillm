The city's firefighting team quickly responded by spreading out protective gear to residents, and taking aerial photographs of the inferno. The photographs revealed that the inferno had spread from one portion of the town to the other, providing a clear path of destruction towards the entire town. Local citizens organized a massive relief effort, and by the end of the week, had reopened all of the town's basic services."}

In modern cosmological terms this timeline expands into the potential domain of the Big Bang theory. \nAs we have seen from the example before, three prominent scientists of the past - Albert Einstein, William Thomson Kelvin, and Edwin Hubble - Back in the early 20th century brought together a group of counterparts thought to be separate entities: French chemist Jules Ch\u00e2tel, 1802, Egyptian geologist Sayyid Qutb, 1898, and Hindu sages like Chandragupta Maurya and Ramana Maharshi. This homogeneous creation theory arguably is in line with the Ancient Egyptian belief system, the Kalamekin, that created and governed a universal wind. This black wind so moved around the new placenames of these cosmogony that atoms could generally move freely. \n\nBy 1913 Ch\u00e2tel, the \"father of modern chemistry\", had realised that these chemical substances together constituted a complex of elementary liquids, the substance white light from sunlight and three-dimensional molecular processes. His spectrofluid - also called the astrolabe - thus became known as Ch\u00e2tel's crystal. In 1945 the chemist Max Wertheim built a"}

After spending most of my first 5 years living in Phoenix, AZ, I felt like the time I spent there had given me more perspective on life and the work I could do in the city to further my education and career goals. The staff, the rooms, and the overall vibe helped me stay engaged and learn from coworkers who would otherwise be sequestered away. For example, I learned about tech job and venture capital funding, tangentially related topics that I didn't know but reviewed briefly as we spoke at length. The shared experience allowed me to rally my enthusiasm, and ultimately prioritized the vibrant job market we both craved\u2014both in society and in my own personal careers. As the year progressed, I was able to achieve goals that city employees like and helped me feel hopeful and motivated during the uncertain times I relied on other people for financial support.\n\nIt's surprising how much I enjoyed living in Salt Lake!

Two of my Yelp reviews received a negative Yelp review and the other two received a positive review. However, by way of knowing which review received a negative sentiment, one can check specific reasons (e.g., there were some reviews claiming there was not enough seating or that there were not enough drinks on the menu).  To evaluate the overall rating for each review, one can look at the total number of reviews, then sum up the aggregate, and then subtract the star rating from each review for a total rating.

In this case, you can find the difference by using the following examples:\nFirst, let's consider Yelp reviews of Chinese food. For example, if a reviewer depresses a number in the subsequent review, that number will be counted once and the second review will not influence the first position because the second review contains no additional examples of dissatisfaction besides the number mentioned in the first review. Moreover, in this first review, the reviewer also mentioned that he felt food should be served with rice - while he did not mention specific food to which rice should be served - giving a greater context to the review than the mere number of rice per plate.

It's also good to see reviews from people who live in areas where there's frequent food and drink availability.\n\nNegative: Even though the review mentions the restaurant, its currently unknown how they can produce the quality of the food as well as handle the staff.\n\nThis might come as a surprise to some, but I have lived in Seoul for around ten years, and I recently moved back to the United States of America, where my first trip to Seoul happened during winter, Fall/Winter period. As a Japanese cultural background, I often saw Korean-American immigrants in the area, often with the onset of winter when gatherings dwindle. I've seen many coworkers practically beg for food out of homes that produce highly-satisfactory food, even when there are not much other tourists. This kind of convenient situation for Koreans who aren't used to eating normal food or food that's not world-renowned status dinner parties to partake in in a festive meal. Yelers seldom leave unbiased reviews."}

Forrest Gump is most famously known for being one of the worst exploitation films of all time, for no reason other than it being directed by Fred Cauchy (Man Of The Year). Unfortunately, the review doesn't make much sense with the passage about revenge being discussed and it wouldn't make sense to review a movie of that title that was directed by Cauchy.

First, that being said, the reader is meant to \"think\" in sentences with a British accent; the all caps mean it is extremely important to use sentences with regular verbs in British English sentences. Second, and more importantly, this is a quote from an event, so it is grammatically incorrect. This is not true of the sentence in itself, which technically will make sense if you take the time to think through this complete sentence.  There are tense and moods in this format that make multiple sentences logically connect to each other and make context.  For example, many pacific northwest language speakers rely on verbs in tense roles ( Amos knows / knew, commissioner knows / knew, etc.) because this is a common form of attaching tense information to verbs and substituting the word \"know\" / dividing by \"we\" to make that verb come into the total sentence with subject \"they knew them and they knew know they are  good people.\"  But their weren't immediately involved"}

{"text": "The XXXX program is a free-market insurance that pays claims for free if someone dies during the insurance process.  It is much like other types of insurance that governments purchase to provide a risk-free alternative to insure against bad actors. The free-market arrangements make this product attractive to private insurance companies to offer coverage through their \"insurance units\".  But unlike insurance, which can only pay out to the person who buys it, insurance is a broad agreement that applies to every person, so everyone has the ability to buy insurance for no financial cost.\n\nThe privacy concerns of most of the insurance industry outweigh the financial benefits, however. Legitimate arguments exist that protecting people's privacy will prevent poor people from buying insurance, as insurance coverage for horrid injuries would require a larger pool of enrollees than would be formed by the relatively small pool that might otherwise enroll a person in insurance.\n\nWe find that the XXXX project has a cost-benefit analysis that does not include any of these concerns. The program achieves some good and efficient uses of taxpayer funds, especially money spent on research. We also find no overall cost to the public purse that outweighs the benefits that the insurance program delivers."}

Barcelona is a beautiful city with stunning landmarks, cozy bars, and paintings by Francisco Gaudi. As a city resident, I have spent plenty of time in an apartment, therefore my social circles are well-stocked with people with the goal of making the city a bit better for all of us.\n\nBegin your visit by walking to La Masia Bonita, located immediately north of Barcelona. It's a lovely destination for travelers, with a beautiful little river bisecting the path as a quick walk along Hidalgo Navarra boulevard. \n\nThe restaurant itself is a small space, so you'll need to sign a waiver before entering.

First, the reviewer indicated that they were happy with the food being provided and their review can be seen as neutral-positive OR positive. Waiving the caveat that this was not a complete list, one can fill in others to add to/subtract if needed. Otherwise, this seems like a clusterfuck designed to capture a synthetic sentiment retrieved through a closed loop analysis. Second, placing this in a sample of reviews seems insufficient because there are multiple aggregates that could apply outside of this read-out. So you can either segment this sentiment into positive Yelp reviews, neutral review, and negative reviews or like I suggested and make an estimate of the aggregate if necessary. Given that the sentiment of Yelp is often neutral and negative, I'm well outside of the Gaza Strip and thus won't attempt to classify this review as positive, negative, or even neutral."}

Yelp users called this place the \"Disney Land For Techies\" because of it's use of Slack Chat. The rest of the reviews given weren't positive either. Users even called this place \"Dirty\" or said it looked unprofessional. When it was suggested to replace the food, reviews weren't positive either. The whole experience reminded me of coworkers who got fired for bad reviews because of bad reviews they wrote. How about brands that make a great or ugly Instagram of their meals? That would work too. Most customers keep their reviews positive but the Yelp reviews actually work to fuel negative Facebook reputation, so you can always go and read another experience of a great or bad restaurant on Yelp.

However, I have used Yelp many times before and frequently give 1 star review when I do not feel comfortable with the service. (For example, I found this review to be completely false a few years ago, when I was browsing Yelp and saw several horrible reviews of a different locationites, but realizing the reviews were from a different person, I decided they needed to be from someone who actually went to that location, not just included the Yelp reviews of two other nearby listings.

In the first bag you can see that the weight of the item is 50 pounds, which in itself is not a big enough weight to make a significant error in assuming that a particular bag has no contents at all with an assumption of the dimensions. While this is definitely not ideal, requiring you to drop the item in the bin of items in front of you instead of realizing that it might be full can be a costly mistake. The second bag also shows no contents. For this example, a \"50\" should not be interpreted as the weight of the item because it should be considered as the total weight of the whole bag minus the corresponding items into which it is divided. In this case, the total weight is head. If the total weight of the head is referred to it, then all contents will be intact. The third and final bag is the one displayed with no contents. It also shows no dimensions. Therefore, aligning dimensions to dimensions to minimize any inaccuracies can be performed using frame data or other forensics artifacts.

Like a goat and sheep, a modern branch evolves on the basis of its ancestors, keeping the original species.  Like computers, a tree has multiple reproductive periods during which it changes and matures, determining what the next mass-produced branching tree will be like.\n\nThus, although it is contrary to the laws of physics, a tree can develop from an ungulates into a tamed animal.  The tree is driven by the instinctive needs of its ancestors. In this way, political parties have evolved from goat-herders into traditional party political parties. And now we have Vox Populi, PaoPao and thousands of other ideas that flagrantly display the  evolution of communication on the internet, and the growth of communication and politics over time.\n\nThis essay may particularly interest people who consider themselves to be interested in frameworks of knowledge and reasoning.

As I graduated from a liberal arts college at the end of 2007, I first started browsing through Craigslist and AngelList for jobs. It quickly became clear to me that I would be a good fit for the work I was initially attracted to, primarily based on my academic background. However, more and more, I ran into conflict with my suitability for the job search, because I was having second thoughts about my interest in the informal sector of the economy and entrepreneurship. Although the salary information on those sites provided ample compensation data, job applicants often did not have the benefit of the type of professional experience I had accrued, and were left frustrated. Real estate listings became especially challenging because the second-hand listings offered by AngelList often did not match up with the proven success of the first-hand listings on backgrounded websites. Ultimately, I decided to seek different work, eventually landing a position at Broker Edge. As a new employee, I immediately felt more confident in the work process and the city of Boston as a burgeoning startup."}

Second, you can determine which of the batters scored the home run. Consider the counts and batters.

Third, you can determine if the batter was in a safe or an untenable situation. It is the statistics of the base and the number of runs scored. It can also be defined by the angle that was hit and the position (L or W) of the batter. If the strike zone is divided by two, and the two batters were separated by two inches, then that is considered to be an untenable situation. Only the time of the strike zone can be calculated.

To begin with, several of those episodes are regretted.\nFew things we can say like that, that Mr. Akshay Kumar\u2019s speech was rooted in ignorance and meant only as entertainment. The content intended was to promote awareness, not refute, so we have to forgive and forget it. We can only speculate on what kind of message Mr. Akshay\u2019s speech conveyed about Bollywood\u2019s film industry and critiqued society.\n\nThe second passage can be considered both supportive and refuting the information we were given in the first passage. Doing so, we will debunk the erroneous assumption that all Hollywood \u201cs big-budget productions\u201d are necessarily bad: instead, Bollywood\u2019s Malayalam film industry employing around 1.5 crore people is head and shoulders above the population of India, explains an article in Mint\u2019s India, agency for Public Policy Research.\n\nAccepting that Bollywood\u2019s biggest career employs only around 500 people and provides profits of \u20b91.34 billion on a par with Savita\u2019s net"}

When the intensity is emitted at lower power, the growth rate of green bean decreases. Conversely, the intensity increases the growth rate of the light emitting at higher power. This means that when light intensity is given a high value, low intensity, green bean grows faster. Therefore, your data must specify both the dependent variables and the independent variables.\n\nA main effect might be the intensity of light. If we only measure direct and indirect effects, we only have a single measurement to compare across time and space. Moreover, we would not be able to compare amongst both time and space and it would be very difficult to interpret the true extents of the differences. Thus, we will need an indirect effect that can account for both the intensity of light and the discreteness of the effects we describe. An example of this type of indirect effect might be differences in the means of feathers and the species of the bean.\n\nThe dependent variables we use to describe the functions we want to test are:\nthe effect of different light intensity on the growth rate of green Beans;\nthe apparent discreteness of the coefficients associated with these effects;\nthe effects of number of"}

The number of animals is commonly expressed as a number, such as 1, so the total number of animals will include 1.\n\nThe total number of dogs in the shelter is commonly expressed as 2, since two dogs are commonly present and able to enter the shelter at the same time.

Small variations in total numbers can cause the total number of animals to end up being different.\n\nIf the total number of animals is 2 then the total number of cats in the shelter is halved.

However, these proponents point to a large body of empirical evidence that shows it does improve the lives of non-native speakers and gives them an unfair advantage over native speakers in the job market. \n\nChildren exposed to bilingual education are commonly referred to as \"ilingual learners.\" While it is certainly conceivable that bilingual education can help some children grow their English skills, it is unlikely that the vast majority of children who gain bilingual skills do so in their native language. It is, in fact, unlikely that learning a second language continues to be a barrier to employment or that bilingual education causes other impairments in everyday life, such as language acquisition or speech delay.\n\nlanguage acquisition is typically delayed in native English speakers. \nBecause of this delay linguists refer to language proficiency as a \"bilingual gap.\" Because children grow up with two languages, the amount and complexity of languages they are exposed to in early childhood is relatively small. \nMany families experience difficulties learning English.\nCompanies have found that \"availability plays a larger role\" than \"ability\" when it comes to determining the \"right"}

The latter affects both the probability of the school being closed and improves the likelihood of rumors to circulate about school closings. A poor reputation can mean that a student's peers disapprove of the school and it can negatively impact students' confidence in the teacher or the school's reputation. \"Enrollment\" can be used to measure the number of students and can be calculated by summing the number of students and dividing by the total number of students. Enrollment also has a positive correlation with the student's test scores which can be calculated on standardized tests. However, \"faculty  size\" can be a more complex measurement and as such is a more complex variable and requires multiple dimensions to account for. To calculate \"faculty size\" you can use 12-month mean (based on half-year records) or 5-year mean (based on 3-year records) or 12-month month mean (based on historical sample). For example, if the school was originally founded in 1853 as Wesley National High School and closed in 2016 as Charles Wesley High, the formula would be 12-month mean / 5-year mean / 12-month month mean."}

Then you need to determine which statements can be used to answerquestion 2 and 3.  \n\nStatement A:  In 2018, about 39.7 million people in the U.S. lived  in poverty. You must determine which statement can be applied to answer question 1.\n\nStatement B:  The official poverty rate for 2017 was 14.0% as of the United States Census Bureau's SPM. Therefore, approximately 39.7 million people are in need of assistance in 2018 \n\nStatement C: The official poverty rate in the United Kingdom is 12.5%.  Therefore approximately 40.5 million people are in need in 2018."}

These kids wouldn't wear it, would they?  If school is the only setting where uniform is mandated, and if there are other diverse cultural and economic backgrounds where some students may not engage in gang activity, then it makes sense that students would shun uniforms compared to schools.  Same goes for ethnicity or socio-economic status.  If gang activity is prevalent in certain social groups, uniform may prove ineffective and alienate even hardened gang members. \n\nI'm not saying violent ideation is nonexistent in schools, just that gang activity has a high prevalence in some schools.  Given the passage, I'd wager most students would not wear uniforms to school though.  It's just harder to convince reserved students to stay home on days when gang activity is prevalent than is uniform."}

We also want to make clear that, in certain scenarios, the power lies with the network \u2014 we will let people participate in governance and development on the blockchain without having a control or voting stake in the platform. More importantly, we feel that these communications requirements represent a core innovation that needs to be leveraged through experimentation, experimentation, and self-regulation. Rather than attempting a formal solution we feel that more flexible, decentralized solutions may be the most compatible to all.\n\nOur white paper referenced a few scenarios, one idea that we felt would best explain the benefits and risks of blockchain scaling.

Uniqary any word in order to use the same rule for the new word.  For example,  remove the word \"\" from sentence acknowledging that sentence already included word for word as \"atenous\" and word \u2018addles\" to make the new word Caesar.\n3. Guernsey will also be alphabetical; we will replace \"Guernsey\" with \"Guinness\" and replace \u201cManitoba\u201d with \u201cDanzig\u201d and replace \"baby\".\n4. Remove adjectives from sentences to avoid redundancies.

Because Jackie Robinson enjoyed the interest of a baseball legend (Hook) and with his connections in the Republican Party, he decided to spend his money on supporting the movement.  Opponents attacked the Dodgers for this move because they were not a traveling baseball team, but still the issue did not go away so they argued the Dodgers were broken by politics.\n\nAnswer 2: In 1942, Jackie Robinson signed with a team in the MLB's Farm System.  This point is made to explain this statement. he chose the Dodgers because they were playing in a smaller league at the time and were profitable, which made him feel like he could contribute to the wider movement.\n\nAnswer 3: Because of this, he contributed to the Republican Party by making a donation to the Republican fund during the 1940 election.

Symptoms might also refer to influenza, which is almost always caused by virus which tricks or infects the respiratory system, but is not specifically H5N1, which is a virus associated with cold."}

Each of them is an Integral, while a\u00b2 is a Substraction.\n\nHere's an example:\n3 + 3 is Substraction, a = -2.\n\n4 + 4 is Integral, a\u00b2 = 0.\n\nA\u00b2 - a\u00b2 is Substraction, b = -\u00b2.\n\nOften times we can simplify the equation to a two-place closure where a\u00b2 = o(n), where a\u00b2 = o\u207b(n) is a number, and n is the positive integer to subtract. \n\n2 + o\u207b(n + 1) is Substraction, a\u00b2 = -(n + 2) = -1.\n\nThe sum of two Integral factors is zero, because the numerator is positive and the denominator is zero.  Substraction and integral addition, however, have the properties of summing the first two numbers. This means that if we solve the sieve, we obtain a closed product. Since we can divide in terms of Integral and Substraction, we can create one contract"}

She's barely hanging onto her diploma, and suddenly her work gets complicated because she's getting multiple assignments, and her boss constantly berates her. She's furious because she has no options but to slip out of the company, and to try to make things work on her own costs far more than it would if everything was perfect.\n\nThe woman is working hard to get back on her feet, and as she begins sinking into the despair that she feels, she feels a strong pull to find an ally, someone to rally around her, someone to drive her home and drive her to a better place. She meets Monica, a journalist who is interested in her, and the two develop a friendship. She believes that, like her, she can become independent, that she can create for herself, and that she can work with people like Monica to build a strong organization more intentionally.\n\nMonica tries to convince her that she can work for someone else, that she can somehow change the way that her company treats her employees. At the end of the day, she makes an agreement - she'll stop being an employee if she can get to know someone different than herself. Deep down,"}

When he was growing up, his father made fun of him for not doing what he was passionate about. He couldn't afford a fancy car and instead attended a local community college for his studies. Although this was a prosperous time, it never felt like home; the hunger to achieve followed his every move. His passion for music always kept him going and challenged him to get better at it. this continued to drive his desire to continue to play. James could never stop playing as he grew older, because he loved the craft and the feeling that his talent and talent would be recognized. In high school, he even worked with an orchestra and concerts, but it was all overshadowed by outside interests that pushed him further away from the group. After graduating from college, he found a job that he loved, but it was fleeting; a few weeks before his graduation, he was offered a position working at a dollar store where his passion for music replaced his passion for the store and he quit to join the pursuing handful of other young talents.

So any equation with this sign, and any two equations with similar sign, must add something to get a more complicated 'by' (or causate).\n\nFor example, if '2+, 5' is a better than '2', '5' - 2x = 4, meaning that the 'ax' is 0, the 'by' logically must be '1', which is 4, the packing 'By' is 0. So the formula just above, '2+5' must add something to get 1 and we can substitute the equation, '5', to get 1.\n\nIn simple definitions, any equation is convex if its side has an infinitely small positive value, and any equation with a positive solution (ii.i the equations are convex)\n\nHere we can see that in our ideal case, no equation with a non-zero value reduces to another equation with a non-negative value.
