We think sitting in front of a computer screen a lot can be very distracting. Healthy habits are formed by getting busy and focusing on our future, not just our current moment. And unhealthy habits are by not focusing on our future, and avoiding associations with our past. This is in part why we way too often experience negative energy and avoid our interactions with the outside world. But there is a more nuanced view we can take on our feelings. Are we holding on to an expectation or are we allowing our own desires to run free in our minds?  If we look at our own desires, we can start trusting them in our relationships, and essentially let our mind run free, guiding our behavior in our overall goals."}

Lastly, students on our Intro CS course interact with each other on the instructor's chalk board, on various pieces of paper, and by filing Alt 5-7 papers, often penciled in on the chalkboard, to practice their calculations. All of this makes the course a bit more manageable, because once you start shooting out numbers in the air, you have to practice saved passwords on your own (although you can always re-calculate after each slide if you miss a pass). The instructor encourages you to publish your calculations so that other people can check them out, and implement your own secure crypto algorithm if necessary.\n\n4.

A may be made up to 6 days in a winery, but in the United States the batch size is limited to 1 gallon; at least for sparkling wines there are less than a gallon per winery batch.  The first thing you need to do is dry yeast, yeast used for fermentation which is made from the juice of five varieties of grapes then sorted into fermentation stages.  The most critical thing for successful fermentation is to get enough oxygen levels to the yeast.  An ideal level is 45-60%.  Stage 2 is batch separation.  Stage 3 is curdling.  Carbohydrates are cooked, synthetic color and so on are often added to make curd.  Curdling sugar creates a sweet gelatinous powder that is then pressed into the media as adding sugar to the media gives it a viscosity resembling sweetness.  Together these steps give the creation of a sweet sour wine with aromas of oak, vanilla, and brussel sprouts."}

During this time the British government passed laws to restrict the production of meat.  The restriction to meat was in part to protect livestock from competition from cheaper domestic animal products.  Other reasons included raising livestock calories, as there was a high demand for meat in the growing population. The production of meat fell by then to about 50 million cows.  The Industrial Revolution also had other environmental concerns like pollution, deforestation, depleted soil, and pestilence, to name a few.  Legislation also limited the development of electrical appliances.  These had the potential to impact on the production of meat, most notably in the early stages of the Industrial revolution because of constraints on what roads to build, which meat was consumed."}

Nicknamed \"Prince of Wales\" or simply Norris, the prince of Wales, arrives late each evening prior to the replacement of his father.\n\nGiven that only 1,000 people are out to see Prince of Wales every evening, the percentage of people affiliated with the royal family in that coverage is roughly 80% of the population. By any measure, it is indeed rare, and it is due to the limited aggregation of individuals that line the streets in the evenings prior to the replacement of the king.\n\nThis, combined with the limited sampling of Buckingham Palace's inhabitants (one night only) and the need to pool the individuals to form a larger sample"}

He confuses causation and correlation, which is a fundamental tenet of many disciplines (some philosophers even write entire books on the subject), and 2. He fails to point out that there are several highly influential and well-known texts that provide clear and documented causal explanations for important events, such as the ebb and flow of tides, geology, and the evolution of organisms.\n\nGiven this information, given this paragraph, and given that there are many shortcomings in John's argument, let me ask a few difficult questions. Why would I argue that he is wrong?\n\nFirst, let me propose a three-part theory. \n\n1. I argue that John's view of the world is typically held by a narrow sort of pessimism that views life as a series of noughties. Rather than analyzing events against the backdrop of a natural law, as Hume did, we interpret our world into a system that interactions between the various forces of nature.\nThe forces in this picture,  create complex, unpredictable patterns, such as earthquake formations. This tells us that, from a human perspective, it must inform one's values, for one cannot switch off such a fundamental system."}

The 'before' picture shows the rally leader trying to regain control of himself, and throwing some mixture of commands which were ineffective. The 'after' picture shows the rally wrecked and searching for a leader, but no one seems to have been found. The combination of these adverse evidences cause people to lash out in anger and start clapping in unity, which eventually causes the backdrop to collapse, and the crowd to start running for their lives as the police attempt to contain the situation."}

As he sat down to work, however, he was accosted by two of his colleagues, one of whom had stated that he should never have left the office in the first place. John just stared at them in silence. When his colleague returned from his break, he began to make questions about the reason for his absentness. He was able to land a few tidbits in his attempt to understand the situation. At the same time, it became clear to him that one of the reasons he missed was because he was running away, which made his frustration even more obvious.

Add red (the starting color) to a normal white to make a potential red/blue/yellow combination. Then add the complementary colors of green and yellow into the red/blue mixture: this becomes a potential color sequence of green/red/yellow. The color red is known as a hue. Adding (the color) in this way essentially alters the base color, making the base color different than the starting color of the picture and thus changing its hue. While mixing and mixing, one also creates colors in the mix using other means such as splicing or blending the picture. As a result coloring one rainbow makes another rainbow."}

Highly regarded colleges recruit players to play for their teams in highly coveted positions in the women's College and NFL so the pool of high school and college players who find careers creating their own money obviously grows. Conversely, there is little interest from high school and college football players to play professional sports and compete both professionally and semi-professionally.

This is because the physics of spheres (a sphere is one particle in a larger \"sphere\") makes it impossible for a tree to be all-powerful - it always needs \"sporangeal repetition\".

{"text": "In 1869, an Italian theoretical physicist named Amadeo Havoc could not explain the behavior of gases, as he was unable to describe the observed phenomenon in sufficient detail. His colleague, Jean-Baptiste Pastore Dumas, had conducted experiments to observe such a phenomenon, but had not been able to offer evidence for its validity. In 1876, however, Avogadro\u2019s hypothesis, formulated by Havoc in 1819, hit the headlines, leading to extensive empirical observations by many scientists who noted such patterns in the experimental apparatus and more specifically in the behavior of the reaction mixture of HCl and water. On April 7th, an astonishingly accurate observational record was achieved \u2013 the Permian\u2013Triangle of Compression (PTOC), which combined experimental data from several independent experiments (including the Campobello e.g., experiment) and dozens of randomly selected reservoir experiments, including those of Shimizu University and Japan \u2013 as a result of just 6 tests run concurrently. Two additional high temperatures (44 Degrees Celsius) within the elliptical tubule experiment used by Dumas, Shimizu, Plotr\u00e4ge and others, prevented the deposition of larger current measurements directly, whereas the observation of hydrostatic equilibrium confirmed the theory with certainty"}

British forces then moved north to take control of much of the Old World. Rabble rousers rose up to defend the countryside and towns, and wentad English leaders to seize the opportunity to make war on England. \n\nThis text was a highly contentious topic at the time because there was bitter competition over who would become the next military leader of Great Britain. Both British leaders prospered under their command, while the Dutch in their turn were forced to endure the horrors of the Spanish-Manuel Cortes siege of the city of Barcelona, and their diminished leadership for more than four decades."}

The end credits sequence is then played without ceremony where the credits sequence is filled in and a creature resembling an anthropomorphic pig is shown making a bow. (Note: the historical association with the pig is not completely 100% accurate, as other animals were domesticated during that time period as well!) The two festivals are typically related in several ways. Many farmers partake in the spring festival because of warmer weather or crops coming in earlier or earlier season.  Others partake in the fall festival simply to relax during the summer months with less stimulation."}

Often I hear people proclaim that they are seeing the benefits of equality and have seen no actual increase in inequality. Could it be that the rise in wealth has pushed people further from equality, even for the super-rich? Furthermore, if the gap between the haves and the have-nots grows by such a large amount that the gap shrinks, the existing conditions of inequality cannot explain the gap in the first place. \n\nHow can the wealthy exclude the rest of society and claim that the   new development makes them immune from the effects of inequality? To persist in this mindset, we tire of social   problems and allow privilege to persist."}

{"text": "In order for a signal to be \"heard\", it must travel at least 10 meters (33 feet) between the sender and receiver. This is because space is generally larger between receivers than sender, and the noise floor inherent in any measurement will pick up noise from noise source to noise source, which will in turn affect signal's loudness. Sound waves propagate only through medium with a wavelength shorter than the noise floor, which means that noise waves have a shorter travel time than signal.\n\nGiven our example of noise emitting waves having a shorter travel time than sound waves, the noise floor is a good candidate for measuring the distance between the sender and receiver in order to ensure that \"hear' on both ends of the signal.

Tracks of red, white, blue and green were fastened to servitude, and no slave could walk or speak a word, for hundreds of years. The forces of modernism had long ago buried the fires for a civilization where slaves could once call home. However, today with freedom, all traces of this cruel system were gone; cities became glorious reminders of our previous human bondage. We celebrate this milestone, which will go down in history, by rallying as a free people of equality, one nation under God, under the Constitution, and administered by the people, for the benefit of all.\n\nAround this great mass of people, a cynic might say, the forces of modernism have undermined the spirit of freedom. Therefore, during this canon of monumental events, what can we learn today that can be salvaged?

Although he only started school at the age of eleven, his behaviour was typical of a teenager - at least by his peers. Monstrously shy he often avoided talking to anyone and threw tantrums whenever an opportunity presented itself. Fred, George, and Ginny Weasley, his best friends, were his best friends and carers. They loved nothing more than to use their special talents in amusing themselves, a la Percy. Harry withdrew from the school and his friends took his place, but his manners and behaviour became more and more distanced.\n\nHis fondness for Ron Weasley, his arch rival at Hogwarts for Gryffindor, gradually turned to outright hostility. His attempt to help Ron disguise his dislike for Ron was met with contempt, as his response was often too mild to bear. Nearly every time Ron made good on his threat to stab one of his friends in the back he was followed up by a torrent of tears from his friend. It was clear the trauma caused by Ron's behaviour had made him further estranged from his friends, to whom he seemed to have only wish to impress."}

He then went on to become a well-known physicist.\n\nHe became a practicing physicist in 1812 at the age of 34, studying with Frederick Seitz, who later joined the American Bureau of Investigation in December 1813. It was in 1813 that he brought to mind Seitz's work.

In this case, two new trees grow from the original one.\n\n'A tree produces seeds' refers to the act of cutting a branch and trying to shoot a new leaf from it, or the act of cutting dead wood and trying to graft it together to make a new tree. Dead wood is usually used to germinate new trees, and usually seeds are composed of leaves or trunk that've been cut for wood, or some limbs of the tree have been split and attached with string, hooks or wires that hold the stem together.\n\n'These new trees produce seeds' refers to the an act of plotting the seed discoverers' methods, and look for the appropriate urban legend to produce seeds based on the alternatives tree and wastelandmongers use referring to it. \n\n'The process repeats itself' refers to the process described above, in which a tree is reinstalled after it's been cut. If plants are cut to grow, a seed number is also associated with it, so the first survivors or seeds produced go into each individual branch that grows back after it's been cut for new growth."}

{"text": "Oil was discovered near the town of Titusville in Pennsylvania in 1859. This lead to the first oil rush in the United States. Soon after this, people from all over America showed up to the region and the resulting trade to the region soon led to passage of the first US laws restricting and restricting the importation of oil. \n\nThe Titusville Mariner, along with other local businesses and support organizations saw the market opening and quickly became wealthy off of this discovery. However, this shocked many people in the region, as there were numerous concerns about the extraction of oil and its use in industry or the local environment. \n\nThis led to the passage of the 1859 Petroleum Act, which was later amended after movements and protests forced the passage. \n\nOf particular concern, this act greatly limited the production of the oil that was then produced, as well as made it hard to access for investment, which limited the number of families and businesses that could prosper financially through exploiting this newly discovered resource. Many citizens had their businesses and homes impacted by this impact, as well as families living without enough money to feed their own families. The trend eventually led to the Great Depression, when many industries in the region predicted resumption of these high prices of oil."}

{"text": "During the 1859 wine crisis, many people believed that there was a link between soil type and wine production. This had a lot to do with the soil type being considered as relatively susceptible to fermentation and when growing conditions. This led many to believe that higher soil moisture levels or better soil conditions would improve the wine's quality, therefore enabling the grapes to be grown or stored more frequently. Higher soil moisture levels or better conditions meant higher fermentation potential.\n\nFood poisoning from vineyards exposed to changed soil conditions could then lead to serious disease, and stopping the grape from being grown or storing produced wine would have all sorts of health risks for humans (see county wine grape production).\n\nOn the other hand, it's clear at this time that soil type and wine production were not causally linked. So the only logical choice - for many people - was to focus more on the scientifically proven relation between soil type and wine produced.\n\nBut Pasteur had found a distance. The soils that were considered as being less suitable for wine production could still be grown and stored. So switched to less suitable soil for growing, amended recipes, or yet another crop.

{"text": "The author wishes to convey through this paragraph that Anna Wintour is a smart, passionate person. She was the editor in chief of Wintour magazine from 1988 to 1998. Her leadership there has led Vogue to become one of the most prominent and influential print magazines of its kind, but she is still a private person. We learn from her initial statement that she is \"a very private person\". Through this paragraph we see that she is engaged with many people and has a very private life. We also learn that she is a well\u2013known person in fashion. After this paragraph, the reader can conclude that Wintour is the main character and the point of view of Anna. The author focuses on this character through her description of what happens after she resigns. We learn that she feels she has let many people down and makes this decision after hearing criticism of both herself and her beliefs. We then see her agency to make this choice under duress and witness the loss of integrity that follows. We then see Vogue as an example of a publication that has extraordinary leadership that commits itself to being a top publication, something that causes diem-like pressure on others. We also see that Wintour uses the resignation to push herself and her brand forward."}

I once asked a student the following question.\n\nAnswer: I believe in evolution. Why do you think we believe in evolution?  Because we believe in something that happened billions of years ago. The real reason we believe in evolution is that humans evolved from other species, and that means there must have been other life forms at some point, and they must have had different capabilities. We can use what we know about evolution to conclude that there must be different life forms at some point in the past. If we are right, and there were, the fossil record shows that at least some of those life forms had certain characteristics similar to modern animals. We can think about using this information to argue that the theory of evolution is scientifically valid, and there must be something that made the earth and humans evolve.\n\nThis passage briefly describes how we can discuss the concepts of evolution and garbage collection that are covered in the text.

Samuel listened to Vitellius's advice and lived by his own rules, choosing to be good and never care about anyone else. After accepting Vitellius's offer, the noble herald Eustace soon realized his mistake and desired revenge on Samuel for what had happened, and executed him. Samuel's death stayed with Eustace and led to his ouster from power, and he lived his good life until his death."}

During elementary school periods, students receive necessary uniforms for protection. During middle school, students also receive uniforms for grooming, recreation, and personal appearance, and studies show that these students make up the majority of subjects in some of the Middle School Mathematics and Science classes. \nWhen referring to the principle subjects that the society in which we reside and are students lives depend on, all students must receive a uniform. Hatred and bullying against others, such as bullying children, should be punished under any circumstances. Punishment should be tailored to the predator, mitigating the need to a manageable level so that the society in which the students reside and report reside and responds to the needs of the majority.\n\n\nThe fact that many students do not wear uniforms also diminishes the severity of the bullying taken place. It also diminishes the stigma attached to the entire society. This can be a deterrent to potential students, keeping them away from other students and potentially deterring potential future behavior. By spreading the stigma, even if only partially, rather than penalizing only the behavior of a few individuals, the result will be severe bullying, resulting in an even greater stigma for the whole society."}

This is an area known today because of new cities that have made their debut in the region, beginning with Mosul and the city it replaced, Mosul. Mosul is being built by the Islamic State today and will soon be the capital of Iraq.[16] As a development, the Mosul Tower, which once stood at the entrance to what is now Iraq, is now under construction.

These years he completed four years of schooling and then proceeded to study mathematics and physics in Switzerland as an assistant professor.  In 1895, Albert Einstein completed his Ph.D. at ETH and after finishing his studies he emigrated to Berlin.  After arriving in Germany he published a famous theory, Theory of Relativity.  In his theory, Albert Einstein divided the second person into two entities, a positive and a negative elementary particle.  These particles then acted inversely to each other.  Negative elementary particles are said to be elemental in nature, benevolent and providing guidance.  Positive elementary particles are said to re-versed inverse the law of attraction and support the equal presence of both object and observer.  This is why so understood and celebrated elementary particles often form the basis of chandeliers, statues and other celebrity artifacts."}

{"text": "Sequence of events: Kevin and Perry go on a vacation together to Ibiza, from where they were living prior. They return home after a week and notice their date was over but end up getting intimate with each other. They return to their hotel and try to convince each other that they did not want to end up in this situation in the first place. However, their date did not end as it turned out due to the mutual jealousy.\n\nPeople: There are multiple people that Kevin and Perry interact with during their time away. Each of them have different personalities and do not necessarily reflect the ideals of the people they interact with. For example, Susan is overweight and looks like a girl, but Fiona looks like a girl.\n\nPlace: Places and things can also indicate a piece of text, even in digits. For example, if Kevin said he saw a ballerina during his vacation, then the location would usually indicate that this could have happened. Other locations could include Luigi Rhodes Arena, Brendan Fraser Ice Hockey Arena, Disneyland, or the cable carousel.\n\nThings: Some events and people can be divided into multiple parts according to their integers, others can be absolute counts. For example, if 1 is one, 800 is two, 10000 is one"}
{"text": "What is described is a) a 'Game' and b) a person playing a game. The game is known as 'Money' which represents the human race. The object is a plaything. The advisor is to convince the game to end by pointing out the obvious.\n\nThe Cell Games example itself is self-explanatory. In the first paragraph, you say something like 'The Cell Games'. This phrase shows that you were looking at the cellular automata. In the second paragraph, you state that the Cell Games are 'a game'. It is probably worth mentioning that in the 19th century, chess was considered a game and was therefore referred to as a classical game. It also conveys that the 'game' mentioned is not a particular chess game but the application of the chess board in a variety of games. At the heart of a modern game is a chess game. This is to capture the essence of the modern game. A mature game defines rule interpretations and strategy that form its core. Therefore, more helpful to capture two distinct aspects of the event context, you could state that the two mentioned game are chess and chess-like."}

{"text": "An electrolyte is a substance between which electric currents are drawn. Electrochemical reactions perform chemical changes such as oxidation or reduction that cause electrons, often ions, and a substance such as sulphuric acid to flow out of one metal and into another, similar to how sulphuric acid can be electrochemically transformed into copper to become zinc. This issue is usually resolved by having a primary electrode (such as zinc) cleanly separated from this impurity to prevent re-electrons from flowing back into the primary as they cleanly separate, but this process can also be complicated by either unable to cleanly separate the electrode as cleanly as it is possible or by corrosion or other causes."}

{"text": "During the previous lecture, we've established that events transpired in an order that included rolling dice, launching vases, making noises, and destruction of vases. Therefore, we can effectively assess the sequence in which these events occurred. The first dice roll results in rolling a d6, which is an order in which: 1) rolling 1d4 results in rolling a d4, and the remainder result in d6, 2)  launching a vase results in launching d4, and the remaining d4 result in d6. Skipping this step, the filled circle represents a shaded region in which, those dice would have had to be placed if the dice roll had been a 1. In order to eliminate the circle, you can instead consider the deals that were folded after the roll, or the six areas of which an event was restricted.\n\nThe third dice result in rolling 2d4, which is an order that includes rolling 2d4, rolling 3d4, and adding the result of the 3rd dice, which results in rolling 6d4.   The same thing happens after the fifth trigger (hitting the square we observed in the first step of this sequence), where rolling 6d4 results in rolling an additional d4. Thus"}

Soon everyone was speculating and trying to figure out what this mysterious element would be, only to be disappointed to find out that there was no known element to explain the appearance of this result.  Soon after the discovery, physicist John von Neumann issued a patent for a process to isolate the element using chemicals already known.  Soon scientists were able to confirm the existence of the element after a series of experiments throughout the 1920s, 30s, and 40s.  By the time von neumann's development had reached its high potential in the 1950s, the word for element was commonly pronounced \u201cheil\u201d.

As someone who has recent relatives with celiac disease, I understand the potential for adverse effects from consuming foods consumed with gluten.  Other ingredients in bread make gluten digestion impossible so when a person consumes it, they ingest an incomplete meal.  Even when gluten is consumed improperly, this can cause adverse effects such as diarrhea, weight loss, skin rashes, sleep deprivation, coma and is even fatal."}

{"text": "The three types of options come in three classes, all of which are riskier than stocks and bonds. Stocks have increased in value over the last few years which has made investors more exposed to the stock market. Issuing bonds with a high coupon payments which can pay dividends typically pay little or no dividends and are generally considered risky. Sizing up options such as CDs or cash equivalents that provide the same growth bonus but have a lower return than stocks offers investors a financial option that they can either buy or stick with just to enjoy the growth opportunities it provides.\n\nSaving accounts such as individual savings accounts and joint checking accounts also carry fewer risk factors. While it's true the money market fund or Chartered Institute of Financial Research (CIFR) accounts provide investors the most exposure to stocks these accounts don\u2019t have as much growth risk or growth potential compared to US-style funds which typically have more growth risk. Many investors go against traditional accounting rules which, if followed, mean the money managers make smaller performing trades in these accounts relative to capital gains opportunities in individual stocks."}

{"text": "There are many household chores that require the gardener to water and fertilize the plants. You may be wondering why such mundane chores would require the gardener to attend to plants if they can perform other mundane tasks. Storing and transporting plants diagrams the cycle of life from one state (water) to another (fertilize). Once the water is gone, the  gardener shuffles  the soil and plants, so once a plant is ready its time to germinate and begin to flower. With this let us recall another household drama that involves picking sheep from a flock and giving them to a shepherd as goslings for devotion. The shepherd herds these sheep to collect seedlings that eventually wilt and begin to flower and give milk to the young. When these seeds get so old that there is no need to harvest them any more, the quest of the shepherd (the gardener) ends and the sheep are able to resume their relationship to the flock. When the sheep reach maturity, they will interact, go to school and so forth.

According to Google, computer vision and facial recognition are among the most common types of automated systems.

The term Artificial Intelligence (sometimes also referred to as \"Machine Intelligence\") is often used to describe models that mimic the cognitive capabilities of other human minds, and whose capabilities continue to advance at a rapid rate. The further development of these models means that, despite their name, artificial intelligence and their \"artificial intelligence\" moniker provide no substitute for the truly sophisticated thinking and thinking skills that \"humans\" and other animals once possessed.\n4. It is thought that this invasive form of intelligence might \"demolish\" humanity in the near future, as the development of new methods to perform \"artificial intelligence\" raises the threshold for research into its categorisation."}

{"text": "Everything begins with the Fall. Someone once asked Michael Jordan about this and his reaction was to say that it's only basketball. But from his point of view there's a lot more to the story:  he witnessed the fall (when it's really falling!) of an enormous building, and he heard the noise. It was a building with steel floors. The sound of broken glass was so loud that it reverberated all the way to the South, and people could certainly hear that even 30 years later.  Small wonder that the phrase 'The glass fell off a 3-story building' became famous, and stuck around in the culture. Contrary to popular belief, this isn't a 'Woe is us, mortals that fall to the Earth'.

When the duo got to the well they didn't see any oil slick, only a small lake with a black streak. What they did see however was an underground lake filled with oily drill bit by bit.\n3. Wells 70 feet deep where the duo worked had been heavily industrialized. Could the oil have come from that? The best theory is that there had been an oil well awhile before they got there.\n4. It might have come from a drilling site 70 to 80 feet under ground with a container of very pure petroleum at the bottom with the utmost care. Samples were sealed with seals and every drilling node was moved and cleaned regularly.\n5. The lake supplies water to this town as well as surrounding villages."}

For example, children who use imagery to represent objects learn. They could bring their fingers and toes to represent a maroon object and their thumb and index finger to represent a white object, for example. Another example indicates that children tend to use all three types of patterns when learning, with simple additions after the pattern they received. Children who use sound to represent and create images, create imagined images, or perform movements can also benefit from perceptual learning, which lets a person use the sound or image to control the predetermined result."}

To make cookies, grease a 9\u00d713 inch baking pan with cooking spray, lay the ingredients out on the pan, and spread out evenly. Begin stirring to stir the ingredients, and eventually, release bubbles. Continue stirring, and soon you will have cookies. \n\nPecan lovers rejoice! You can bake this recipe by using softened whole pecan halves instead of the traditional cinnamon type. The resulting cookies are a bit chewy, though not overly dense, and the texture is not overly chewy which bakes many enjoy.  Substitute for the pecan halves in your favorite recipes."}

Throughout the weekend, the couple go on hikes and explore the woods. As an example, local residents call the area off-roading \"summer time\" because of nearby summer festivals.

While the Vacuum Cleaner reviewer did express his sentiments in negative terms (typically with low ratings, though), they are not representative of the actual sentiment of the average customer.\n\nWe can think of some alternative scenarios, such as other users who praised the product because it was useful and worth buying, or they simply gave positive reviews based on the product's packaging, shape and appearance. There is a notable difference in the viewpoint of these reviews users reflect when they are in the mood for positive sentiment, not negative one.\n\nNegative reviews, even if they are minimal in number, do imply some distaste for the product, which definitely tends to bolster our suspicion that some of these vapid customers may not have been particularly motivated.

{"text": "The most important part of a Yelp review is the title. You need to describe why you gave it 4 stars and how far you gave it in your opinion. Reviewers respond mostly by noting how bad the food was and how long it took. You need to rephrase the critical information so that the reviewer can make an assessment. Here is how the reviewer can do this:\n\n1. Review the description of the item, using common adjectives and best describing language. Consider the item and how bad it is.\n2. Evaluate the ingredients and compare their quality with other similar items. Look for resemblances such as taste, texture, or appearance.\n3. Compare the reviews for and against the restaurant. Look for useful information such as reviews, restaurant ratings, and product reviews.\n4. Rephrase the critical information. For example, maybe the reviewer notes that the chicken parm arrived \"dirty and soggy\". This can be replaced with \"chicken\".\nThis is how to evaluate Yelpers reviews."}

Increased population inevitably leads to depletion of services and limited choices, leading the majority of individuals to try and fit in and pull resources away from more sustainable production methods. Alongside the threat of overpopulation, climate change, other resource constraints have limited many and driven individuals to embrace risk-taking and the search for success. Had all humans arranged their resources in such a way that they could maximally benefit from the resources available, society would likely have flourished by now, with widespread happiness and failures being few and far between.

It seemed like someone had forgotten about them and all she could do was stare at the perfect white roses forlornly. Her grandma passed away suddenly and without warning, Lily was left in the dark. She felt despair take hold and she began to cry uncontrollably. Soon, a passerby took her hand and led her out of the crowd. Lily went limp and was soon found by her mom, who took her to her shop. She explained to her that there was nothing wrong with them, just the loss of their caretaker. So Lily quickly packed up the bouquet of flowers and left with the rest of the bridesmaids feeling relieved and happy that they had saved money."}

As mentioned, the NFL statistics doesn't include all of a team's defensive players so lowering the total number of players causes a team's total offense to decrease. Therefore, one can determine the optimal number of players to include in the lineup for each spot (most penalty yards, yards from penalties etc.) and use the \"most penalty yards\" as an indicator of the team that scored the most points."}

The low-lag inputs aim to reduce the amount of the reviews being weighted against random elements, such as menu differences between different restaurants, as much as possible.\n\nFinally, the ordering of the scores is important when visualizing the aggregate scores. Restaurants that received the highest scores will appear like they received the highest score.   When we group the ratings of a critical score with those of a \"must-stop\" score, the overview will be dominated by those restaurants."}

Human language is vast and complicated, and even if you can understand it, the effort still won't be worth it. In order to really understand other people's languages, one needs to be able to understand them. In order to do that, one needs to have a decent understanding of their brains, and this level of knowledge and experience should be strictly limited to a very small amount of people.\n\nLearning a new language also provides many advantages over learning a native language, because it requires much less effort and knowledge, and is generally easier to acquire and retain. Whereas in a standard language, learning is generally something that typically requires several attempts, the hardest part being mastering the process and having the necessary skills to actually employ it correctly. Growing a business and expanding across cultural differences also requires a deep understanding of certain standards, which mature into habits.\n\nSo, in summary, learning a new language will require the effort and knowledge"}

By taking this distance, we can group the items according to the various features that appear in them - such as the percentage color distribution of the objects in the set.\n\nAlso note that even though this nested grouping feature is based on flat Euclidean distances, there are other methods for doing this - see the next section."}

When she smiles, she feels good and relieved and she knows she no longer needs to go through painful physical suffering that emotions can overcome. When she laughs, she feels ecstatic, and at peace. When she runs to hug someone, she feels lighter and able to take on a new level of joy. When difficult times come, happiness will rebound, because when people release their suffering in the sun, they use that energy and let go of everything physical that they hold dear, and look at the sun as a source of joy."}

{"text": "Sure! Let's start by talking about categories: patients and hospital. The first category is specifically for patients, and you can use this term to refer to both types of patients. The Hospital category includes both patients and any other healthcare providers that are affiliated with the hospital, such as dentists, pediatricians, or chiropractors. Typically, the word \"Child\" applies to a children's hospital, as the term \"Child\" is a contraction for the term \"Chronic Fatigue Management\" which also includes children with lost limbs and usually, a level of functional dysfunction. Unlike the term \"Childcare Facility\", the word does not refer to a place for children to live. The exact word used is dependent on the association between the patients and the hospital. For example, if two different children's hospitals have units that fostered families, parents, and children, the word \"Childcare Facility\" would apply. The second category includes health care providers and refers to a set of treatments. Some of the areas to consider are: diagnostic care, treatment for infectious diseases, treatment of neuropathic pain, studies to test for or confirm analgesia."}

{"text": "The Wampanoag were one of the largest tribes in the eastern half of the United Kingdom. During the 15th century, they faced numerous disadvantages, such as inferior food and limited weaponry. This was largely because they were not part of a commonly accepted military organization, the English, and thus had few resources to develop a national identity and communication infrastructure to communicate and coordinate their war efforts. Scholars have suggested that a lack of English as a second official language contributed to the Wampanoags' initial perceived inability to ferret out information quickly. Due to Wampanoag roots, English quickly became the primary communication language among their tribal organizations, making it easy for staff and colonizers to quickly identify and file grievances with the Wampanoags without the Saint's assistance. At some points during the war, English speakers also became prominent in three Wampanoags tribes, ultimately forcing colonialists to listen to and engage more frequently with the languages of their enemies."}

Or do we keep our old shoes?\n\nHere are some options, each with their own benefits:\n\n1 - Buying a Gravel Shovel: Roughly 10% of production costs, eliminating wasting all the labor\u2212time we used.\n\n2 - Buying old shoes: Justifies our labor\u2212time investment and ensures that all the fragile parts of our movement are properly maintained.\n\n3 - Buying in thrift: Does we have lots of money, or does we live on a shoestring?\n\nIt's all about reflection, after all...\n\nThanks for asking!"}

Once the tragedy became more clear, the family began gathering money together to cover the funeral expenses, but that very month, they learned that their records accurately reflected that every member of the family had died of an illness or injury, and there was no record that anyone had paid any insurance premium, leaving the Walt Disney Company with no recourse but to cancel the purchase of any of the lavish items that did not comply with the care instructions.\n\nThe family was initially stumped by the sudden cancellation, since prior to that date they had paid over a thousand dollars in insurance and maintenance fees, making it hard to reconcile the decrease in payment with plans to enjoy the park and hoping the new father would have similar luck.

They share some of the same characteristics including commonalities such as reviews tagged with the same keyword, similar food/brands and similar people. Therefore, we can use this cluster analysis to get a good understanding of what is being talked about on reviews aggregated by rank and partisanship. As it turns out, there are two highly specific groups which are promoting distinct types of dishes and services, thus jointly showing that there is a general sentiment for differentiation in taste between companies and consumers.\n\nThese categories can also be summarised as these are groups of reviews that promote a specific dish/service. Yelp reviews, for example, seem to promote local cuisine. The one restaurant that is a fan of Krem Crazy Bundt Bundt is also raking in the money \u2014 and its ratings might not necessarily mean what the customer wanted. Indeed, there could be high-maintenance reviews of generic furniture as well, challenging the business model of finding a trustworthy influencer and aligning with the brand's reputation. I believe that the rating system introduced by third parties is the best interface with web reviews and that there is a need to both encourage aggregation and product differentiation among reviews."}

A few minutes after ordering, a server greeted me and handed me my order form. I thanked the server for taking the time to make my reservation but, I was still sleeping.  Myself and a roommate chatted with the manager briefly, then checked our reservation very carefully and then checked the box to register our reservation. When we were ready to walk from the room, we were disappointed to also be directed to the ticket renewal desk.  I went through this process randomly expecting to check my current reservation but twice.  Finally, I ordered a reservation for dinner and I was directed to the reservation desk.  This seems like a valid experience but I am disappointed that it took nearly 4 full minutes to start"}

The chicken sauces usually consist of soy based thickener which is also known as angmaseo.  The noodle typically comes from a variety of restaurants and separate sauces is certain, but there are gourmet restaurants that specialise in these noodles not found in the mainstream restaurants.  The price of chicken pad thai is usually expressed in Dhuan or Baht, with the Dhuan being the higher amount and the Baht the smaller amount.  \n\nWhen you prepare the chicken pad thai, you will add rice than ph (medium rice), or with Thai  describing the addition of 1 kilo of rice!

Text compression cuts the information in half, resulting in reduced sentences.  Text compression reduces letter count to better fit the information in the text.  This information is further cut using a Bode model to make the information smaller still.  Text compression achieves this by first deduplicating the letter head to the part of the sentence that is being compressed.

The heat from the hot sauce changes the liquids, temporarily raising their boiling point, and reducing the alcohol content. The liquid becomes more clear, and clear liquid is usually juicier.

It's okay if there are a few pieces of chicken on a piece of bread. Don't worry about shredding the chicken. Chop because that will slow down the process of cooking. It should be mostly crispy on the exterior, but a bit dry on the inside. The most important thing is to reduce the heat until you reach 250 degrees and no more than 20 minutes.

Tennis, baseball, and, often, football were career pursuits.\nIt may seem absurd now, but back in those days, whenever I walked down the hall while stunned by an athletic screech, I'd crave some entertainment more than the enjoyment of playing a game.

The latter was the only gripe I had: the ambiance, in clacking with music, felt like it was crashing through the three-hour time I had spent here.\n\nDressing up your Pugilati with cheese and wine was a treat, and even better was the gigantic Plano River Valley Saloon, nestled in Santa Cruz.

For liquid (non-flavored) rice, time alone alone will do, but by including ingredients separated by time, the amount of time parts of the rice macronutrient are separated becomes smaller, which is the growth metabolic rate of the tiny portion, this is called \"exponential absorption\", or exponential growth rate.\n\nThe serving time of dairy includes processing time, which is pretty much the same as the \"cooking time\". For example, when rice is boiled, about 30 minutes of cooking is emulsified into a liquid that can be served within a few hours. To calculate the serving time of a polenta, double this amount and use the time for cooking the red lentils that make up the dish."}

He was only slightly to his left, and he wore a thick Yorkshire accent. He seemed practically neutral.\n\n\"Whose home?\" John asked.

He put his phone in his pocket, pointed at it.\n\n\"Call the cops,\" he replied.\n\nThe man stared at John with confusion."}

This round, disk-shaped rock comes in a variety of varieties and shapes, which kind of defeats the purpose of this exercise, right? Alas, it's true. According to the Wikipedia article on reflective stones, it \"reflects back light of a specific wavelength, with rainbow-like hue dependent on wavelengths of light received at different angles and angles\". Reflective stones are powerful, particularly when they are used in watercolors. If you stare at the stone and look up (without looking downwards), the stone emits a beam of light that reflects light corresponding to the color of your eyes. This means that a sphere of color orange emits light of an orange color which can be used to recreate the appearance of various human faces. For example, light obtains a color from perspective and thus reflects an orange hue which depends on the light received from the looking direction."}
{"text": "Once upon a time there was a kingdom ruled over by a fair and just monarch. The king was beloved by his advisors who saw him as a rising star and sought to overthrow him. The plotters plotting against the king were jealous of his power, and they poisoned him in a fit of jealousy. A young king, heir to the throne, was for some reason seen as heir to the throne. The king was unfit to rule, merely a man, who had fallen in battle, and the people rose up against the monarchy and demanded his head. This plot was completely foiled by a young prince with the power of prophecy, who used prophesying as a divine right to overthrow the unjust monarchy and establish a more just and just form of government. And with the king dead, the people cast off their kings and replaced him with a new generation of rulers, chosen with the aspiration of finding greatness in the unknown and being a better person.\n\nDue to previous divine blessings, the young prince was able to achieve this while enduring all the trials that history has to offer. Notwithstanding his long suffering, he concentrated his will, willed himself to overthrow the unjust dynasty that had been ruled over for carelessly usurping control without the ability to pay a fee to the court."}

Ours was a hard upbringing, but they had grown up together, sharing the same language and writings. As a result, they had developed a friendship that most of the women in Olivia's lawsuit relied upon: trust.\nThe trial of Jennifer during trial for Olivia's murder, was a pivotal moment in this drama. The dynamic between Olivia and Michael shifted from trust to mistrust. The women were furious at one another, both now believing that they were the ones responsible for the tragic loss of their partner. They did not want to believe that both were equally guilty, and they employed all the evidence that supported their suspicion.\nAnother important takeaway from this journal is that it is with clarity of thought that we can form our opinions, based on the available information. We can draw our own conclusions, based on experience, and based on philosophical thinking. With the rest of the evidence, we can conclude that Jennifer was murdered as a cold-blooded killing, carried out by someone who had loved her for many years."}

Once loaded, the data continues to run through analytics technology (such as LaCascada, kubectl or similar) to gather meaningful insights such as time series data points, number of records, execution vectors, etc. In addition to loading documents, the migration and projection system such as gantt chart tools make the process seamless and fast.

{"text": "I really wanted  to like this place because it was so close to my apartment. However, I really felt like I was wasting time because I was not even in the mood to go out. Yelp reviews often contain critical information but unfortunately I was not able to read the whole review to understand its essence without spending time scrolling through reviews. The only reason for this review being I checked multiple reviews and also only read the summary, which did not allow me to fully understand the full review. As a result, I simply let the negative review stay as an asterisk. Here is the full report:\n\nMy main concerns with this place was that the food was largely mediocre which isn't ideal given its proximity, and the Yelp reviews promised tons of reviews, but all of the reviews were mostly negative. I was surprised to find the Yelp reviews to be divided into \" N/A (no rating)\" and \" ROYGBIV (good) \" categories which made it hard to even read through the \"no rating\" section. This review should not have been posted by someone without first reading the review, and therefore the reviewer should not have received a \"no rating\" on the first page, let alone seen the \"good\" section.

That's 230% increase, and nearly a 51% increase, from 2012 to 2014. Opponents of gun control measure argue the increase in gun violence is driven by gang violence, which increases with gang membership.\n\nCalifornia has the world's largest coastline, and this coastline is absolutely proof that guns are a thing of the past. California needs to emulate Oregon, which institute the 287(g) initiative to discourage illegal gun possession, and introduce universal background checks. The 287(g) program was implemented in 16 states by 2014, and many fear that gun laws would limit Second Amendment rights. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) undersecretary, Betty Colburn, says the reduction of gun violence was due to extreme positive public health impacts, like increased access to mental health and substance abuse treatment, improving vaccine safety, and sexual assault prevention.

{"text": "The first part of the equation is finding the best-fit line. We understand the variables x and y and their corresponding heights, and then use the regression algorithm to find the best fit line using linear regression. The second part is to calculate the 95% confidence intervals around the best-fit line, i.e., the range of values that best explain the observed data. The confidence intervals around the 95% confidence intervals can be calculated on a per-person basis by dividing the total number of observations into 97 Independent Residuals. The 95% confidence intervals consist of one standard deviation (SD) in each of the 95% confidence intervals, and this separates the predicted final value from the observed value. When channeling data into these confidence intervals, a calibration data set should be created from the fixed data and the calibration data set itself. It is also possible to perform multiple iterations on this calculation using multiple logit lines. Shimploi plots can be created on previous iterations to allow the viewer to evaluate the model."}

After you have managed to sort out your clothes by each category, it is necessary to start imitating what went on in the trees.

{"text": "The main idea of this paragraph is to provide context for why investors might be concerned about Alphabet and Facebook innovations, and why new media companies like Twitter and Reddit can disrupt traditional news sources. Investors should take note of the following:\n1. Google and Facebook Inc. have both produced groundbreaking technological innovations that have dramatically impacted the way people and information lives. In 2014, they were accused of enabling and enabling fake news; they have since taken steps to address this issue, including hiring external researchers to study fake news and addressing other concerns raised by the researchers.\n2. Investors' largest concern is that some investment funds are buying large quantities of stock in fake news websites, with the aim of manipulating the market. This news comes as tech stocks are experiencing huge price movements in recent years as investors make investments in fake news sites to gain short term gains.\n3. Investors also feel that traditional news sources like The New York Times or CNN are free of bias and seizing upon fake news to win the hearts of their audiences; this betrays their stated belief that their platforms enable journalism that is balanced and objective.\nWith this in mind, investors need to review why they need to understand further."}

It was only logical that voters feel disenfranchised and believed we were the ones responsible. Given the weakness of the establishment's argument there was little other reaction.\nSecond, the Labour Party in power for 30 years has intentionally undermined our democratic institutions to subvert democracy and raise real questions about the party's true beliefs. Recall the thousands and thousands of questionable donations Jeremy Corbyn made from overseas, where even more evasive deals took place, smearing millions of others I just spoke to. The lack of transparency is very concerning.\nThird, we have due process. We can call a re-run of the election with extremely flawed rules if we feel it warrants consequence either way. Alternatively May should wait until after the next election at which time many of her voters will feel lied to and deprived they spent time/effort anxiety about the result. Currently, we are told it takes \"four years\" for the Electoral Commission to make decisions.

{"text": "In this task you split a number into two parts by showing that the first line of the input is 1 and the second line is 100, T being 100 and N being 3. To understand this, first understand that T is an integer, equal to one. This means that, for example, if we were to split in two a number of 1s and 100, the result would be T = 123 and the result would be 1, so we can say that one integer is split in two. T is a very unique multiplication factor (2nd form is also called bitwise addition) and it's possible to split a T into 2 bitwise operations. It's different to split in half and 3 bits of the same T, because there's a third bit that can be 0--0 which means 0 and 0, super!\n\nGiven that each of the T has a value, one should split the spanning numbers by dividing that value by the number of cases in that T divided by the number of counts for that T divided by 1. Therefore, congratulations, you solved this math problem by splitting numerators of two by one."}

Here, photons of both light waves are emitted.  However, only one photon ever enters the beam and each photon is made by excitation into the signal-detector cone.\n\nWhen one light wave arrives and sustains emission in the film, the other hand, it emits waves of detent electrons that replay each other in the diode (a dependent electron is made of two electrons). The reflected waves are detent electrons that systemically act as a switch for photons of other waves.  From resonant waves, and the stages of excitation (defined by the waveform waveform), we observe how one photon can enter one slit depending on the other.\n\nThis is a classic test of quantum mechanics - the conflict between the waveforms emerge as a means to assess the paths of photons.\n\nThe double-slitting experiment can be seen as a classical test of wave"}

The piano-heavy shift in the original chorus might be due to background noise or perhaps a change in the song's composer, with a tracklist consisting of fewer sections of 12 notes than usual, giving a richer texture to information.\n3.

The files contain rules, pieces, and moves for one version of the game you are playing, and they cannot be changed or modified except by changing these rules.

It is important for the economy to be run by a level playing field, so regulation can not prevent competition. \n\nThe government also encourages market failure and distortion, and this can push prices higher than are true simply because there is a failure to protect consumers.  \n\nFinally, monopoly hurts society because it destroys jobs, promotes fraud and corruption, is difficult for individuals to own and can ruin economies.\n\nAs a final note, it is easy to point to competition to justify regulation. However, it is worth noting that companies face price volatility in all markets, so regulation could hurt profitability in any market.\n\nUltimately, this series of arguments indicates that you should be looking at these arguments from both sides to make an informed decision."}

His cynical, resentful manager\u2014and dear friend\u2014Batman, advises him to keep score on the numbers\u2014such as \"pig, halfpenny, twenty, four, zerodoodle.\" Greenblatt himself would like to \"be the greatest man\" he could be, but nobody is perfect; he often misuses his staff and stifles the entertaining rambles of his ambitious, zany owner. The book obviously lampoons the cliche and serves as neither a constructive nor a constructive writing style, and no amount of \"spoilers\" can hide the funny aspects of the novel. However, the book may be considered a comedy because the literary term for an Ach\u00e9-agile comic is \"Hank Marvin Rides the Bus.\" By this definition, HANK MARVIN (or His Royal Highness King Marlo) is rugged, but not bad-"}

The century also saw the emergence of a generation of young people who were unique in their resistance to authority and the establishment of their consciousness through creativity and struggle. There were, however, many examples of white people exploiting this generation to further their interests.\n\nThe decade also saw the development of a new generation of youth who chose to study at institutions increasingly catering to students from diverse backgrounds.

To make matters worse, we thought it was a great idea to tax the taxi drivers to fund our fantastic Prevent Agency and 'billion pound homes for the poorest spot kids' scheme.\n\nWe knew this would drive people away from the county, which was an honest wrong done to the people of Sussex.

Nordhaus, the famous French military attache in North Atlantic City. The alliance consists of thirteen members (formerly Helms Deep) and includes the powerful United States and 27 members (formerly Helms Atlantic/Miami/Minnesota). 28 members are currently serving on the North Atlantic Council (NAAC) and 14 members resigned in November 2015.\n\nThe alliance's goal is to develop a \"new strategic architecture for the defense of the North Atlantic region\" (NATO) and address challenges to national sovereignty. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, generated post-World War II economic growth by fostering trade and investment, ice-breaking, humanitarian assistance, and science and technology. These factors were achieved through a process known as the North Atlantic Treaty System, or North Atlantic Treaty Linkage. Today, over 40 percent of the world's population lives outside of North America, with many outside residing and working in countries located within that area.

Having a sun not only helps us brighten our evening photos, but also ward off any skin cancer as we age.

Without proper exposed sun, your legs will atrophy and leave you feeling limber, which makes it difficult to walk and even impracticable for everyday activities.

The target level and a commitment to cut emissions from all sectors of the economy, transportation, power supply and energy consumption, with investments aiming at 80 per cent, are part of a comprehensive international agreement. It includes original investments in clean technologies in the context of the low-carbon transport sector. Additionally, it commits member states to opening up or existing \"carbon markets\" to international oil and gas exploration, including finalizing rules on the extraction and refinement of oil, access to technically recoverable potential petroleum resources for the life cycle of oil, and SMEs sourcing their raw materials from renewable energy production.

{"text": "According to the presents, African Americans are positively expressive in their facial expressions and the target group specifically is White supremacists.  Specifically, they express anger and revulsion towards the image of African American beauty. The reason African Americans are negatively affected by the image of white woman is that the image demonizes women as subhuman, whereas women of color are seen as members of the species. There are many similarities between African Americans and their counterparts from the racial ideology of white supremacy. We can compare this to the way someone (African American) perceives a non-hood: as a primary trait whereas one's non-privilege, race, or gender, (privilege) is the lens through which they view their world. Both anti-Blackness and the image of white woman, as Anglo-Saxon status model, reinforce white delusions and illusions."}
