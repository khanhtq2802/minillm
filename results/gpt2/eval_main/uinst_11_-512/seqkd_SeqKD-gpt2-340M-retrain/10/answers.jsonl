The types of stars that we can see around our star are designated by the number of supernovae we can see around a particular star. These are supermassive black holes (for which there are many supernovae), and the number of them is called the number of compatible black holes. If we plot the number of stars in a region of the sky divided by the time taken for that star to rotate, we can see that the star's mass is concentrated around a central point. The star's radius is therefore much closer together than the average radius for the region. This makes it seem much closer to the center."}

In the first example, 'Most people skip breakfast because it doesn't have time', the statement implies that most people skip breakfast because they have too much time to themselves. In the second example, 'Breakfast eaters usually are slimmer than those who do not eat breakfast'. In both cases, the implication is that skipping breakfast is a behavior that is neutral to the main idea.\n\nOther examples\n\n'Few people','many people','snowshoe eaters','snickers eaters','mulled wine', 'pickled vegetables', 'lazy', 'hip'."}

Now nearly 14 years later, we still have students who bully other kids just because they are kids. These kids should not be bullied, and should be expelled from school. The policy statement is also worth noting because it creates a positive atmosphere at school, and also creates a feeling of belonging within the school, similar to how other students feel when they attend a school with a similar vibe. Finally, the policy statement is worth highlighting because it has an additional benefit to students whose behavior makes others feel unsafe in school. If all students wear uniforms to school, then everyone can be safe at school."}

The player runs from one block to the next in a sequence of columns, one at a time, until only one row remains blank. The player can then fill in the blanks with numbers from 1 to 9.

Do you enjoy winter tires or summer tires? Climate can also affect how you prioritise between these 2 options.\n- Terrain: some tires have more or less snow on the road and that can affect the performance of the tire as well. Look for snow-free days or have you found a great spot to clear the snow before you start your drive?\n- Model: it's nice to see how other people's opinions and experiences compare to yours.

The Yelp app is based in the United States and has thousands of reviews from across the world. \n\nOnce you have found the restaurant with the highest score, you can then rank the restaurants on the Yelp app.  The higher the rating, the more positive the review.  Visitors to the restaurant will also see the restaurant during their visit. \n\nThere are many types of reviews. For example, floodlights are very positive reviews, while a reviewer who focuses on a specific restaurant gets zero stars. Additionally, reviews from strangers may not be 100% positive."}

The core of Western European history is traced back to the Bronze Age, a relatively short period of approximately two millennia C.E., when for the first time in history, a coherent writing system was developed and common to all of Europe. This development led to the Renaissance, a period of approximately five centuries that saw the European nation emerge from the Dark Ages. The Renaissance also saw the birth of a new classical language, the Latin Vulgate, and the development of a system of weights and measures that would eventually become the foundation of modern western finance.  These and related developments are what gave rise to the later Renaissance and the sixteenth century English Renaissance. \n\nBy the end of the fifteenth century, Latin and Greek had become the official languages of Europe. The establishment of the European university system, which by the end of the sixteenth century had a division in philosophy, astronomy, and history, was also instrumental in ushering in a period of intellectual rigor and unprecedented levels of cultural and social change.\n\nThe end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth centuries, however, presented a more complicated situation.

Yelp is a very large aggregator that aggregates reviews from many different users and enables the company to determine which reviews are good and which are not. \n\nYelp has many reviews that are similar and can help you understand what customers are talking About. If you use Yelp's aggregation model, it can become overwhelmed with the amount of data it can accumulate during a review and the CPU and memory requirements for the reviewer's computer are different.

Then turn the heat to medium and let it simmer until the liquid is thoroughly incorporated. At this point, you might want to remove the foil and place the chicken in a bowl, adding any liquid that may have leaked out of the oven. In the bowl, mix with the other ingredients and fold to incorporate the liquid from the chicken and the sugar.

Although Chicago has similar programs, its recycling happens during the summer, which is a more convenient time to pick up after the trash.

I am deeply concerned that Chicago's recycling rate will increase over the next few years, because the city has such a high reliance on municipal solid waste.\nCalvin, Quincy and Westfield City collected over 180,000 tons of garbage between April 1 and October 31, 2015. Of this, 86% was trucked offsite, and the remainder was recirculated through recycling trucks. Although this program is available year-round, my city is faced with a monthly garbage collection during the summer, which means that many residents end up with no or minimal use of their collection bin during the months of April to October. Additionally, every day of the year, residents are required to pick up their trash from a garbage dumpster. This is contrary"}

In contrast, the American colonies are usually independent and each state has distinct laws and customs that cannot be infringed upon. Additionally, in America, the confederacy is often considered a more federal structure than the union between states. While England has a system in which parliamentarians are directly elected, the American system has a system in which legislative bodies are controlled by the President for the duration of an election. This means that legislation can be passed by the American Congress without the requirement of the King's approval. Another difference is that in America, the \"migration\" act allows someone to immigrate to the United Kingdom at any point of their life without the need to leave England."}

{"text": "The Pope made this pronouncement while addressing a joint session of the Italian-Roman Catholic bishops at the Vatican on Wednesday : any Catholic priests or bishops with sexual relations will be automatically disfellowshipped, in an effort to root out child abuse in the Catholic Church. Pope Francis made the announcement while flanked by his security detail and close personal friends, including journalists, photographers and other Vatican insiders. The Vatican initially appeared to be unaware of the pope's pronouncement. But when news of the pope's comments first broke, it stirred up a debate within the Church over whether bishops who had been celibate should be able to resume their positions. Some 200 cardinals and two Vatican prebendates issued a joint declaration asking the pope's clarification. The Vatican has since taken steps to ensure that only bishops who have been celibate and only priests who have not been married are able to exercise their episcopal power."}
