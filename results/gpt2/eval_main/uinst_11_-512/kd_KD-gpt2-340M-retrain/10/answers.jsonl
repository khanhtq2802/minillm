{"text": "Hi.\n\nI was wondering if you could tell me a little about the development of Hadoop and how it has evolved over the years.\nAs an open source project, Hadoop has developed a lot over the years, and has become more general and flexible. Initially its use was for heavy data processing, running on commodity hardware. As this technology evolved further, Hadoop has evolved into a suite of tools that can be used for a wide range of workloads. One of the most popular tools for Hadoop development is MapReduce, which is an efficient programming model that allows you to build big data structures in a parallel, distributed manner.\n\nThe Hadoop ecosystem is also well known for its bug and security bounty programs. Hadoop generally provides a very high level of security guarantee, with the use of modern hashing algorithms and MD5 hashing. Other security features include ACID guarantees, notice suppression, time travel, and so on. \n\nHadoop is an extremely powerful tool that has benefited greatly from the efforts of the Apache Software Foundation."}

{"text": "The paragraph should read as follows:\n\nIt is common knowledge that elephants, although large by most peoples standards, are not the largest land animals on earth. Having a small body, they are considered to be very healthy and extremely well adapted to survive on a very limited diet of only about 2-3rds of their original body weight per year. Despite this small body, they have developed remarkable skills in motor skills and non-verbal communication, including vocalizations and eye movements that most humans can pick up without training. They are not known for their empathy or motivation, and many times do not respond to human contact.\n\nAs a result of these adaptations, most experts agree that they would be unlikely to be able to continue to have the giantess they once were on a diet of about 2-3rd of their original body weight a year. The loss of any body fat results from a lack of digestive and assimilation factors that led to the giant elephant's reduced size, making them extremely unlikely to survive on a diet that consisted of nearly 2-3rd of fat a year."}

{"text": "Yelp reviews can provide useful information about business and sentiment. Here are some questions to test your knowledge of Yelp sentiment:\n1. Do you agree with the following statement: \n\"I ordered take out food and received pad Thai and spring rolls.\"\n\n2. Do you disagree with the following statement:\n\"I ordered takeout food and received pad Thai with spring rolls and don't like it.\"\n3. Do you agree with this statement: \n\"There are 6 types of reviews, I picked the 6 worst ones.\"\n4. Are you sure you want to include all these in your summary?\n\nI believe using Yelp reviews alone to provide business and/or customer feedback is useful. Yelp reviews aggregate multiple pieces of information into a more comprehensive overview than could be obtained through a single review. Additionally, the business or customer can evaluate the summary by performing additional research such as: \n1. Whether the customer keyword is captured in the summary or not.\n2. Whether or not the reviewer selected a specific product or category of items.\n3. Whether there are duplicate reviews within a category or not."}

Then, we can further categorize each review according to how much overlap between the reviews, their location, and the other reviewer's words in the reviews. For example, if there is significantly more overlap between the reviews from two different clusters, we can eliminate the third cluster and focus on the positive reviews from the second cluster. Let's call out the positive reviews in the second cluster as well: they have very similar words in them and are therefore more likely to belong to the same cluster. Let's also separate the negative reviews from the positive reviews to further reduce the overall overlap. Finally, let's call out all of the other reviews into one cluster, to preserve the anonymity of the reviewer. This is a mixture of reviews, so it is possible that some of the reviews might belong to multiple clusters. However, your task will be much simpler if all the reviews were organized into one giant review aggregate."}

First, a big thanks to everyone who donated their time and efforts to make this possible, even if just for a token donation, I am very happy to keep learning and improving myself. \n\nLet's get started! \n\nStep 1: Getting Started\nGetting started with a classic Final Fantasy is easy. In this guide, we'll cover basic movement and attacks, identify an enemy type and attack range, and help you level up your party. \n\nStep 2: Strategy\nDefense is king for most Final Fantasy games. We want to make use of that to our advantage in order to score points and clear a path for our team to take over the map. The objective is to clear a path to the exit of the level, get loot and powerful weapons, defeat the boss, and reach the end credits of the game.\n\nStep 3: Action\nLet's take action! Our best option is to stay back and use our strong combination of physical and magical defense to take out the boss. However, this could get complicated if the boss is immune to our physical attacks, and even with our best defenses, we still have a hard time taking him"}

{"text": "Yelp reviews are divided into three general categories: quality, price, and quality of service.\n\nPRICE\nThe first category is the price. Restaurants and grocery stores often charge a price for their products. Restaurants and grocery store prices typically include local advertising and are often marked up by the restaurant chain, such as $1.35 + local crackers for a lunch crowd. This is a great way to get a good feel for the quality of the food being served. Yelp does not distinguish between fresh and frozen food. You will need to look up the type of food being served to determine the price. Restaurants will also sometimes mark up the cost of fresh food in their reviews with a different price. For example, frozen broccoli might cost $2.13, fresh broccoli might cost $0.99, and skimpy broccoli might cost more. The key here is to look at multiple aspects of the food being reviewed to determine the price and type of service being provided. \n\nQUALITY\nThe second category is the quality of the sandwich. Restaurants and grocery shops frequently test different types of bread, including sourdough, flat bread, more advanced bread, and more traditional bread. You will need to check the quality of the ingredients"}

It's due to the fact that it is spread over a large number of files and requires a lot of engineering effort to handle small changes efficiently.\n- The delimiter needs to be very tight - any spaces or hyphens should be stripped out.  All of the special characters that were there to make our life easy in the old formats (such as '.,') have to be there to make it work correctly in the new format.\n  The code that generated the output from this example is straightforward and can be run on a large number of files.\n- The only required characters between the special characters are backslash, carriage return, and special sequences.

For example, if we find the intersection of the x coordinate with the y coordinate of point A, we will have found the largest subset of points compatible with the condition that A and B are from point A.\n\nSubstituting the input into the next point, we obtain the largest subset of points : \n\nx = -1\ny = -1\nx + = x - 1\ny * = y - 1\n\nx = x - 1\n\ny = x 0\n\ny = y 2\n\nSubtraction of this value from point A and point B produces the largest subset of points in space, which we can use to find the largest subset points in 3D space."}

For example, it can help us understand the rise of fascism in history and understand the reasons behind World War I.

When the same person is reviewing a negative experience, the latter is called negative feedback."}

Here is a sample of some of the most common Yelp reviews:\n\n\"Yelp reviews are not that great, but generally speaking, an organization will prioritize the accuracy and customer service of their reviews when determining how to make improvements. Yelp has a notoriously bad habit of selectively editing negative reviews and allowing others to pass off as positive. This Yelp review is no different. Despite its bad reputation, I've found no other reviews of this quality elsewhere. Overall, a solid 4/10 star rating.\"\n\n\"Yelper review is subjective and anecdotal, but given the extensive reviews of this business from previous years, I'd wager a good guess that many would consider this a perfectly average Yelp experience. This especially applies to reviews from earlier years, when the business may have improved significantly. Given its poor Yelp experience, I'd give this a 4/10 star rating now.\"\n\n\"YELP is a wellspring of consumer feedback. Often, businesses use Yelp reviews to try to influence the customer reviews that are published in the places where the business is located.  Given how extensive this business review base is, a natural curiosity is what other customers are looking for. I wonder if they are looking for"}

First, it asks the question \"why\".  Second, it contradicts the \"Yes\" and \"No\" statements in the first sentence.  Third, the last sentence ties together the earlier two sentences, but with significantly different meaning.  This means that either sentence is asking the question \"why\" and therefore should be classified as \" Declarative \" or \"Interrogative\". Do we need to decide between the two?"}

{"text": "The length of the smallest subset of integers is k = 1/2 * 6.\n\nThere are many ways to find the smallest integer less than or equal to k. The simplest is to collect all positive integers between 0 and k and reduce them to one another. For example, collect n positive integers between -2 and k and put them in a count of positive integers across the range [0,1,2,3] where n is the number of items in the input sequence. The count of items in the input is then returned as the number of items in k. The resulting number of items in k lies in the range [1,2,3].\n\nSubquoting is another way to reduce the input to a smaller integer. This allows you to find the minimum integer less than or equal k.\n\nIf all positive integers in the input sequence are between -2 and k, the result is NaN. Otherwise, if all positive integers k is between -1 and k, the result would be a positive integer, 2."}

{"text": "I had been meaning to write a follow-up to my previous album, Everything Everywhere All at Once, but had been struggling to find the right words to express my excitement at the album's release. After finally finding something that made sense, I felt inspired to write a proper album review. Rather than composing an album review, I decided to write two songs for the album, \"Formation\" and \"Verity\". The song structure and the production were heavily influenced by my experience recording the album, so the songs on the album are very much based on that experience. \n\nAs a result, the songs on the album do not refer to the album review, but refer to the vocals of Adele. For the record, I do not have a problem with the vocals, as they are quite good. In fact, I think they are the best part of the album. Check out \"Formation\" and then \"Verity\" below, for both excellent examples of how the vocals translate to the song structure. \n\nThe rest of the interview consists of reviewing the album, which I believe is necessary for any aspiring independent artist to gain a competitive advantage over their competition. If the interviewee is not satisfied with the album review, they have wasted their time."}

Linux has been used only by hobbyists and students, for testing the performance of programs, ensuring that certain programs work well on all hardware, and for testing the behavior of programs when they are used. Linux is known to be very bug-free and feature-rich, and many users of Linux installations have carefully written kernel sources to make sure that it runs well on their systems.\n\nMost professional computer architectures provide some level of user-friendliness, so most users of Linux enjoy it very much. Linux distributions are available for a number of different computers, providing a range of different system options.

The civil rights movement and the landmark Supreme Court decisions of the late 1950s were a major source of contention.  Black leaders were arrested or jailed, and non-violent protests became more common.  However, the gains for black Americans were not universal. Wage rates remained low, education was patchy and difficult, and many Americans experienced dramatic changes in their daily lives.\n\nBy the time I was drafted by the U.S. Army in 1973, I had already experienced considerable hardships. My first deployment in Vietnam had left me with severe post-traumatic stress symptoms. I was plagued by depression, feeling isolated and hopeless.  After years of difficult physical training, I felt disoriented and resigned to my mental limitations. My experience in the military and on the streets of New York City provided me with a clear signal that the changes I had experienced as a black man in the 1950s were not easily reversible.\n\nSeeking Change\n\nSome people within the black leadership of the United States urged me to seek professional help.

The player then attempts to hit the ball into the hole in the same direction as the pitcher originally intended.  The hitting order should be similar to pitching a baseball. The hitting order should be completed by a player who either throws the ball to a teammate in the hole or else runs to first base with the ball already in play (if the pitcher throws the ball to first base, the hitter will advance to second base automatically). \n\nSecond question - How do you feel about the home run? \nYou can relax by thinking about all the run prevention strategies the hitters have put into place.  How much ground they've covered, where are they on the diamond, how many bases are present and how many outs they have given to the opposing team.  You can even consider how many hits the batter has given to the batter in the last two outs.\n\nThird question - What would you do if I hit a home run, but I ended up pitching it into the hole? \n\nAnswer\tYou would hope the home run bounced."}

{"text": "How will we prevent the next phone addiction epidemic if we don't immediately stop providing expensive, easily accessible phones to those who don't have them? This is a critical issue, and one that has been largely ignored by the developed countries due to a lack of innovation and regulation. In addition to immediate steps to prevent the next phone addiction, we need to do more to encourage responsible phone use by users. The consequences of not providing immediate access to good phones may include poorer productivity for users, less expensive replacements, and increased call volume. This is the exact opposite of incentivizing users to use addictive mobile apps. Instead of providing expensive devices that encourage users to keep using them, we could provide low-cost devices that motivate users to use them, and allow others to get them for free. Just like in other product categories -- from cars to kitchen appliances to personal computers-- the availability, and the convenience offered by mobile devices will determine the success or failure of these devices."}
