Throughout this time, the working class had experienced massive changes in their social circumstances due to industry transforming their working conditions and lifestyles. In Darwin's mind, this provided an opportunity to discuss the theory of evolution in a more rational manner.\n\nWhile the working class in England faced grave challenges, Darwin understood that through study and analysis, they could learn something about their world and themselves. Through his study of the fossil record, he was able to piece together a theory of evolution. The theory itself had a great impact on the academic world as a whole."}

For example, you can check to see if all numbers between 1 and 11 are in fact numbers or some other incorrect list, and if so, to what extent.\n\nBy using your knowledge of how computers work and how lists are built, you can efficiently complete this task."}

In 1610, shortly before his death, he published a detailed observation of the heavens made with the Telescope of Union in Palermo. His observation was so groundbreaking that it changed the astronomical world. Prior to Galileo's discovery, it was widely believed that the universe was entirely filled with voids. Galileo's discovery of the Telescope of Union allowed for the planets to be seen orbiting the sun, and he discovered the four Galilean moons of Jupiter. The Telescope of Union also provided the first clear images of the Earth and the Moon, which were later used to demonstrate the lunar landing."}

Many of these are combinatorial, meaning they can have many forms. For example, the halting problem may be stated as a search problem in which the best solution is to repeatedly generate solutions, each of which may be surprising and hard to find at first.\n\nBelow are some well-known algorithms, in increasing order of combinatoriality:\n\n- ParHanan's constant factor routine, which commonly converts large problems into algorithms by minimizing the James Calculus of operations.  This is often combinatorial, involving multiple algorithms, each trying to solve a smaller version of the halting problem. \n- The Transitive Semagram Checker, which looks for grammatical similarities between words in two languages and tries to determine whether they are similar, called a \"transitive lexicon search engine\" (TLSE).

Thus, question 3 requires a combination of information from the passage to determine how long it takes the moon to go through each lunar phase.\n\nThere are several interpretations that can be drawn from the passage. First, it is possible that the moon does not complete one orbit around Earth because there is ambiguity in the text, or the moon does not have the required functionality to make one orbit. lunar_phase is a global variable that is used to describe how each lunar hemisphere faces Earth. If lunar_phase is false, the moon will always face Earth at all times, even when it is in the same hemisphere as Earth (as it does when Earth is visible from the Moon). If lunar_phase is true, there is a chance that the moon might end up facing Earth during a particular lunar phase, but that it will then remain in a state of synchronous rotation, as it does when the Earth is not visible."}

This is because flight is both efficient andtraumatic, requiring unanimous control of all airflow directions. If a bird flaps its wings in a typical up-and-down motion, only the down wind portion of the wing's surface should advance; the forward air flow should be non-compressible and unimpeded by any drag."}

Hence, predictions for rock tracks are mostly accurate. On the other hand, the predictions for hip hop and folk songs are reasonably accurate as well since these genres usually feature short songs with low energy and anticipate a slow tempo.

One way to find the maximum number words in a sentence is to search for specific words that can be split into multiple sentences.  This can be done by looking up terms related to the topic of the sentence, and splitting on those terms.  Once you have found a term that can be split onto multiple sentences, you can check to see if the sentences have any redundant words, and remove those.

For instance, \"2 cups of wheat flour\":\n\n2 tablespoons of butter equals 4 tablespoons of wheat flour\n4 tablespoons of sugar equals 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract.\n\nThe resulting total quantity of ingredients is \"4 - 2 + 1/2 = 3\". Substituting this into the recipe, you can see that \"2 cups of flour\" equals \"3 cups of sugar\"."}

An example of word order affecting meaning is the following:\n\nJohn went the store to buy himself and apple and crackers.\n\nIn this example, John is said to have went to the store to buy himself, whereas the dictionary definitions of the word buy suggest a more indirect meaning, that John went to the store to get something. \n\nWord order can also have an impact on tense and aspect.  In this example, it is clear that John went to the grocery store to buy himself and crackers.  However, if John had gone to the store earlier, it would have been unclear whether he went there to buy himself or just to get something.\n\nSo, while English is a language that stresses the absolute importance of word order, it is also a language that allows for flexibility and subjectivity."}

{"text": "Yelp reviews can be helpful when trying to decide if a restaurant is good or not.  The points that a reviewer makes can help you decide if the food is going to taste good, or if it's just going to be average.  Here are some tips on how to properly use Yelp reviews to your advantage: \n\n1. Keep the synopsis simple.  Don't go into too much detail or too little.  Yelp reviews are written to be read, so brevity is also important.  If you just skim through the review, you might not understand everything that was wrong with it. \n2. Use acronyms and slang.  Usual ways to abbreviate words are \"(insert adjective here)\", so \"The food was great! Exceptional!\" is a good summary.  \n3. Ask for more details.  If you see that the reviewer specifically mentions the food being bad, or the location being hard to find, ask for clarification so you can understand exactly what was wrong with the review.  This will help you understand where the reviewer was specific about what they disliked."}

{"text": "We can start by finding the nearest neighbors of each points by detecting whether each point's x- or y-coordinate is in the neighborhood of the given point. If the points are similar enough, this should come quickly. Let Pxi and Pyi be the nearest neighbors of P, and let R be the distance between P and itself. We can then compare the values of Pxi and Pyi to obtain a measure of their distance. If R is smaller than some value, then either P or itself are closer than some value, and we can conclude that either one is closer. Unfortunately, this procedure requires real numbers and therefore amounts to a search over all possible pairs of points that are within a certain distance of each other. Fortunately, there are functions that calculate the distance between two points based on their x- and y-coords instead of a fixed distance. These functions are d_p and d_y, which can be used instead of Pxi and Pyyi to calculate the distance between points. Using these functions, we can provide a more efficient solution to the problem."}

Additionally, we are happy to make our streets a little less dirty, and a little greener. In doing so, we think that more people will end up recycling, and the waste will end up in landfills, where it can pose a danger to the environment.\n\nWe request that you consider"}

I've also seen evidence that shows that men and women bring different styles to leadership, which may also contribute to the disparity.\n\nAnother area that Bourne mentioned that I was interested in was the issue of racism. She talked about how there is a culture of silence around racism, and how that needs changing. I agree with her that it does and we should not shy away from talking about it. When we talk about racism, we need to do so with clarity and conviction.

First, you could calculate the area based on the formula:\n\nlength * width * 2 / length\n\nHowever, this method can be inefficient because it depends on the specific shape of the object and its symmetry. More efficient is to find the area based on a Jacobian curve. A Jacobian curve is a graph where the y-axis is the x-axis and the weight of the nodes is proportional to the area of the node. For example, the Jacobian curve for a rectangle is:\n\nlength * height * 2 / 4\n\nThe weighted average of the area of each side of the rectangle is then:\n\n2 * 4 * length * width * 2 / 4 = 16\n\nThe total area of the object is then:\n2 * 4 + 6 / 2 = 24\n\nYou can also calculate the area using one of several algorithms available for 3D geometry, such as areascube, Convex, or Octree."}

Although this is a measure that is less convenient, it can be worth trying if you find yourself voting for someone other than Hillary or Trump.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important not to lose sight of the fact that this is a decision that was made by humans, and although it was divisive, that is still an important part of the discussion.\n\nStay resilient and continue to work hard on your career. You have many options, and despite what the election seems to have thrown at you, you can always rise to the occasion."}

The function permute takes two sequences and swaps the first two letters in each sequence, so that the resulting sequence is a palindromic sequence. In case the first two letters in the result sequence are the same as the first two letters in both the original sequence and the palindromic one, then the palindrome has length = 6"}

Following the direction of the Thumbtack wedge, will lead to (6, 6). Following the direction of both the Thumbtack and Penisleg sweeps, will lead to (7, 7).\n\nThe entire path followed by the robot through (4, 4) must be unique, which means it must end at (4, 4).

Williams wanted to capture this detail by not only describing the scene, but also by describing the sounds available to the poet such as the birds singing, the wind rustling, and the dense foliage. \n\nThe second error is in the description of the love scene. Williams mentions that the \"yearning\" love scene is described as though it were a novel rather than a normal everyday scene. This is because poetry is usually set in the world of the future or the past, whereas the love scene is set in the present. \n\nThe third error is in the description  of death and aging.
