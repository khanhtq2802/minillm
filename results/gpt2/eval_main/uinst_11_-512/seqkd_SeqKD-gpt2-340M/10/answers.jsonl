{"text": "In this task you need to sort a sequence of integers in decreasing order. This can be done using the Sort method, which is almost always implemented as a C algorithm. For example, here is how to sort [1, 3, 7]:\n\nint sort(int n, int rows=7, int cols=0, int flags=1); int list[n]; is sorted by cols, not by integers. But at the same time, each element of the list is uniquely sorted, so the whole sequence is sorted before the middle element.\n\nThis sort algorithm, which has the form [0, 1,..., n-1] or equivalent,[opt], has a way of improving its efficiency by exploiting one of its two weak points, the order in which it is applied: the transfer between arrays. Its implementation is often wasteful if allocating ram and are not efficient. But by using an efficient variant of the Sort method, the reader ends up with far fewer solutions. Here is an example of how to handle a particularly long list:\n\nint list[10] = {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 63, 75, 99, 233, 389};\nAs for sorting integers in"}

Here is something that will read as ungrammatical immediately after you read it: 'A man is thinking about it for a moment'. And the next sentence is entirely grammatical: 'Then he decides to go away'.\n\nThese sentences flow because although both types of sentences have inherent grammatical errors, they do not go to incompatibility because the'man' and 'the street' are sentences and when combined they form a single paragraph. However, if we consider the syntax of these sentences, they combine to form a paragraph because of the odd connection between a sentence and a word,'man'. In this case the sentence 'A man is walking' is grammatically identical to 'A man is thinking'.\n\nPsychologists have proposed various categories of sentence prioritization in which sentences fall into a higher priority order than sentences that fall into a lower priority order. The most common prioritization order according to which ones are prioritized depends on the observed level of grammaticality of the sentences at hand. However, the exact order"}

In order to explain this, let's go back to the beginning of the story: the Out of Control Fires were started by the fact that some campfire lighters were unattended and without sufficient drying conditions. As a result, the out of control fires spread to other areas, posing a great danger to everyone around them. To see how dangerous all these factors were, consider the mountains we are walking on, over thousands of years. A fire caused by an unattended lighter would likely not result in humans being harmed, but as much as we want to help someone extinguish the fires, the risk is still there. Withdrawing resources from sources that can help alleviate the risk of the fires only delays the inevitable, so instead, we decided to help prevent them. By not allowing campfires to persist, we were preventing the spread of the fires, and therefore increasing the risk of the effects."}

Likewise, certain behaviors are colloquially defined as examples of \"causation\" such as eating habits and television watching.\n\nAnswering such questions is problematic because John still fails to account for the wide variety of complex and overlapping causal relationships. For example, if parents are eating a ton of junk food and a child starts to obsessively watch violent TV, then there is certainly a causal link between this viewing and the development of the child's ADHD symptoms. If John is right, then overeating and obesity affects weight and causes ADHD symptoms. In contrast, John fails to cite any empirical evidence for a causal link between diet and ADHD. Nor does he correctly distinguish between causal factors (e.g. flow of food and energy and causal relationships based on prior behaviour) and"}

{"text": "According to a study done by scientists at Princeton University, people when sleep-deprived are typically more impulsive and less settled in their decisions, which can affect their performance in a range of activities. On the other hand, when people are awake, they are typically more self-sufficient and more likely to take initiative in their pursuits, which can lead to them excelling at activities.\n\nThese findings draw a surprising correlation between sleep deprivation and problematic behavior: people who are sleep- deprived are more impulsive and less concentrated, which combined with their lack of self-control, can lead to a performance deficiency. The Dartmouth professor and the team's co-authors, Dr. Charles Aznavour and Dr. Jeffrey Toobin, hypothesized the link between these two phenomena in a 2012 paper.[1][4] According to their hypotheses, each reduces someone's ability to discern their own ability to perform in a variety of pursuits, giving rise to a performance deficit. In contrast, these individuals are much more likely to exhibit resilient behavior, which can lead to success.[5] The study was published in Science Advances.[7]\n\nThe findings of this new study, along with other high profile studies showing regular sleep deprivation impairs human performance in a range of disciplines, have"}

During the 1990s and 2000s, more and more women chose to raise families here, and the nation grew more diverse. Since the early 20th century, many immigrants have settled in low-lying regions, hoping to expand their economic opportunities.\n3. Immigrants are less likely than native-born Americans to earn higher wages, and that gap has narrowed over time. Nevertheless, immigrant families still have the typical challenges of founding and raising children, navigating the complex and largely untenable situation of finding a good-paying job, and navigating the child-rearing environment.\n4.

The reasoning behind such irrationality stems from the certainty that very few locations, if any, are inhabited by life. \n\nThis in-depth research we've embarked on could uncover remote planets, extraterrestrial life, deceased civilizations, abandoned cities, extraterrestrial architecture, extinct continents, pulsars, possible alien life forms that could possess our bodies, ancestral homelands, ancient civilizations, extraterrestrial signal travel, alien flora, extinct taxa, and other scientifically valuable information.

Sedimentary rock: The second type of rock is where all the old rock formations have been buried. This is because layers of old sediments have led to temporary change to new rock formations. For example, when volcanic activity erupts, new lava will dissolve layers of volcanic sediments.\n4. Metamorphic rock: The third type of rock is where some of the old rocks are had changed chemically under some extreme pressure that changed their chemical composition or even their shape. This is when an old type of rock is having to be buried. This type of rock is more likely to be comprised of sudden growth of meltwater from ice volcanoes, debris related to volcanism, or extracted from other areas under Earth's surface."}

They get you out of the slump and they relieve stress and make you feel good in the short-run.

It's defensible, because the passage is in itself excerpted from the text, so you have a good understanding of how long ago it was before you read it. So here are some questions to try: can you imagine you are in a video game and now you are being overwhelmed by a force that is clearly much stronger, more insidious, and much more aggressive? Will you think of the questions that you were so familiar with, and suppress your annoyance at being overwhelmed? Could that be the kind of person you want to be?\n\nIt's easy to respond to some of these questions, and yes, to some, it might appear like a timestamp, so you can avoid constructing a false narrative as long as you avoid reading too much into it.

There is also the fact that spiders can evolve new pair of legs in the same way that other insects do, so presumably, they can actually detect changes in their environment, thrive, develop wings and in other ways adapt to survive. \nIt is therefore fairly easy to see how reasoning about the facts from the text flows directly from the personal experience of one person and what that person thought about spiders.

Each of these qualities therefore produces different memories.\n\nThe author then goes on to talk about experiences that have significant effects on lifetime learning: childhood lessons, poor grades, peer pressure, and s.e. schools.\n\nThese experiences all seem to have cumulative effects. Similarities between a learning experience and a later important event (e.g. a grade in school) make an enormous difference to future grades in an individual whereas similarities between a similar situation and a later significant event (e.g., popularity of a topic) make little change to the degree of efficacy of future studies.\n\nAs an example of how strong these effects are, consider the effect of bullying. Recent research has shown that children who were bullied at school earlier in life tend to have worse grades two decades later, and that they are significantly more likely to experience harassment problems and exhibit other adverse psychological experiences. Other research has shown that aspects, such as avoiding peers, learning norms, or comparing oneself to others at school, all become more important to young people once they enter school. These experiences themselves often lead to improvements in the"}

The first is that John might miss work but start eating before his shift has begun because he's eating lunch. The second is that because John has lunch coming early that day, he might not start working at a bank until 8:45 so the order of events is:\n- John going to start work at the bank at 8:45 before lunch\n- John starting work at the bank at 7:45 or after lunch"}

Some sources interpret delusions as an underlying pattern of beliefs, such as an organized movement of thoughts.  Other sources may interpret delusions as megalomania, as in the quote above, which I may exhibit.  Another way to interpret the passage is \"she is\".  This is a typical but insufficiently accurate (and shortest) interpretation, as many passages describe someone as \"watched\", thought of as an object, or merely perceived as something like that.  This interpretation may account for some of the odd names like \"co-worker\" (Joseph) and \"friend\" (John Doe).  Finally, the most likely interpretation is some combination of \"mastermind\", \"co-worker\", \"host\", \"flasher\".

This statement relies on several factual claims. For example, is it true that almost every Australian person considers themselves to be fairly wealthy? Some people do consider themselves to be poor, and claim that they are taxed too heavily, even though those taxes are relatively low?

The enzymes that are stored in the seed are able to break down the starches into simple sugars, providing the necessary nourishment for the embryo as it increases in size.\n2. Once the egg is fertilized and starts to develop into the desired plant, the conditions are ready for the embryo. It is this moment of finally becoming a plant that provides the most ecstatic feelings for many people. The hardware required for this venture is now present in the mother plant as well. \n3. If required, a young plant can take up the necessary structure, living through the rigors of its growth ritual, and then begin its construction leaves with a sense of accomplishment like almost any other product. But for most plant material, usually present only as a vegetative stage, this functionality is only available inside the reproductive capacity of the female plant. The field of seed science considers this to be a stage where a \"sheep-like\" sub-unit is capable of reproduction. One so named animal that is potted itself into the female reproductive system would technically take up a substantial portion of the reproductive abdomen"}

{"text": "Sure, Mary was probably not very well off at college. She was broke and struggling financially, and had no friends, no family, and simply couldn't understand or connect with many of the people around her. That being said, she did end up getting a job where she made relatively decent money. She even got a dog, which she thought would help her with expenses. She eventually got her degree, and became a well-known author and professor, which made it easier for her to make money after graduation. \n\nExamples of good questions to ask oneself when taking notes on a passage of information:\nWhen did this take place? Was Mary happy at the time? Was she feeling down? Did she have any friends? Did she have any family? Did she have any significant financial debt? Was she experiencing trauma? Had she ever been bullied? Did she have any severe intellectual disabilities? The list goes on and on. It may seem overwhelming to peel back the layers and get a clear understanding of what happened. Studying with others who are similarly affected is an effective way to keep from getting overwhelmed and get a clear picture of what happened. It also keeps you from getting swept up by too many details or opportunities to make the same mistakes."}

Thus, the answer can include information such as; the email address, phone number, city, state and country of birth of the person appearing as their real name. How does one determine if a name is legitimate? One can also look up a news item about a person's real name.\n\n1. Laura Vanderkam:"}

Instead, the pressure to borrow fully turned her into a risk-taker, spending her money at unexpected times and on things other than her favorite things.\n\nMalissa wasn\u2019t alone in her financial misadventures; in her third year at school, nine different teachers made similar errors. Especially frustrating to her, she couldn\u2019t afford to borrow my textbooks - and she was hardly studying throughout the year.When one of her teachers tried to help her buy loans for her college, she hesitated, hoping that maybe by deferring her payments, her system would upgrade, but things eventually went sideways, with her loans requiring more money to buy in the first place."}

I would argue that in this context \"multiple of 2\" is sufficient.\n\nWhat if \"according to the numbers provided, this number is within the range 1-3\"? That does not make it within the range of 2, so the question does not imply that 3 is a multiple of 3. So if it is 100 + 2 + 1, the question also does not say that 3 is a multiple. We want to understand the confusion by asking more specific questions.\n\nIntegration can be a confusing topic, so I will try to simplify things.

{"text": "The study results show that playing video games is actually quite beneficial for your mental health. The researchers paired participants who played video games with people who didn't. Those who played video games also scored higher in several evaluation tests, such as memory and concentration. A lack of gaming can actually make people suffer from depression and anxiety, which is also connected to social anxiety. Another interesting finding is that, contrary to popular belief, competitive video games do not have negative effects on cognitive ability. Even though they score overwhelmingly higher than real-life activities among participants, they scored 14 points lower on average than those who played them just for fun. It may seem counterintuitive that video games provide boosts to cognitive ability, but the results follow a simple logic: if one is theorizing about video games to 'lose' or merely 'gain' in skill, then one'll immediately be motivated to practice smart and avoid situations which damage their cognitive ability.

Here is a simple way of doing it: Take the items at the head of the list, and split them up so that the first item is the quantity for which you want the string to express itself, and then pick a number to represent the singular of the quantity, and so on allowing yourself to include items at the head based on the count you gave of items at that point. Once you've finished splitting the string into threes (which can be done one at a time), you have one 'one' at the head of the string that is the item to be represented by the quantity (i.e. the string is now '15 lbs'). The 'one' should then be removed, in such a way that the resulting string contains the quantity '2'.\n\nFor some function like ProductivityQuo, pythagorean theorem can be applied to determine the order of various operations, and then the order for selecting the right operation will be determined by a program.

{"text": "The income gap has been increasing in most rich countries over the last few years, but it has not been accompany by increased inequality simply because of economic factors.  It is a combination of several factors. First, there has been a sharp increase in automation in recent decades. Much of the work done by technology has been benefiting workers at lower wages. Second, innovation in education has significantly increased the number of high-quality high-quality college degrees available to all people. These factors have combined to make fewer work experiences more broadly accessible, opening job opportunities for people to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, physical education, and more. Third, technological changes have eliminated middle-class jobs that used to be held by working-class people. This has pushed people into jobs in which technology is used to help people achieve things like driving, working in retail, and being great cooks. Fourth, people have been moving to cities and towns that are home to large numbers of workers who typically have lower-paid jobs.  Finally, most people in developed nations have had increasing access to high-end technology.  All of these factors have brought poverty to more people, which in turn has lead to greater inequity and poverty."}

As darkness fell, we started to see more and more of the animals we had seen earlier. Eventually we were able to make some cuts on one bear, but we knew it wasn't safe to camp near it. we hung our lanterns from branches of some trees to protect ourselves as we watched the animals around us.  we were able to make a few cuts on a bear, but when we got close, the rest of the animals veered away from us further away.

{"text": "So let's rephrase this; we understand that Watson and Crick began by discovering DNA was a double helical structure. The data provided by Franklin could be interpreted to show that DNA could store genetic information, but there are some problems with the model they created. So after performing some basic X-ray diffraction, Rosalind Franklin ran some statistical analysis on the data. She may have correctly interpreted the data, but when it came time to actually performing the research, her model was still struggling with some basic issues. Using statistical techniques, she discovered that the structure of DNA was such that it actually did not store information. Tragically, ongoing research to sequence DNA molecules could lead to many human diseases. The discovery of this scientific fact, along with other events surrounding the discovery of the double helix structure that led to many human diseases, lead Franklin to form the concept of a \"junk DNA\". The repeated failure of this model led to many community members believing that there was no reliable way of understanding DNA structure, which led to fertile ground for pseudoscience such as cloning, the concept of alien life, and the development of experimental \"DNA origami\"."}

{"text": "Arms are part of the animal kingdom. Animals are known to primarily use their hands for eating. Hands are the primary means by which they can pick, bend, cleanse, and otherwise perform many mundane tasks. Animals, on the other hand, are not thought to be consciously aware of their surroundings and thus are unable to perform movement outside of their bodies. For this reason, the term, 'hands free', is often used in referring to animals, though it should not be confused with the term 'primitive', as animals fully recognize their presence and make no effort to try and cling to narrow, straight-sided walls.\n\nWork is what most animals do. Animals perform many simple tasks for their lives such as caring for their young, raising chickens, cleaning their cages, and tending their gardens. However, work does not liberate animals by removing labor from their bodies, it simply confines and takes away the agency animals (the primary means by which they acquire their food) have over their free time. Without the freedom of completing meaningful tasks, unpaid labor in this capacity leads to  commodified labor, where tasks are rendered more desirable solely due to the scarcity and connection to tools created by a client."}

{"text": "The main idea of the text is to show that if you shoot an electric shock into the water table, the water will bounce back up. This works because the electric signal travel through water molecules reflects the motion slightly differently than the motion of the water itself. Therefore, the water will bounce up over a much longer period of time when an electric signal is bouncing through it than it will later in the same circuit even if the position of the water itself is, say, close to flat. The bouncing water is called spatial aliasing because it occurs to the signal but not to the signal that bounced to the water. The software that generates the electric signals to measure groundwater reserves uses neuronal networks similar to the gyroscope, where the neuronal network translates the the directional information received from other neurons to its own turning at a slower speed. If the water is really wet, sampling the water every day will produce over a million raindrops bouncing every second when the water reading is on point. The bouncing water gives the software an error, causing it to consider that the user stored the signal incorrectly that the water table is not saturated and try to surge to collect more water from the ground. The bandwidth of the signal is much more small than that of the bouncing water. The electrical signal travels over that"}

{"text": "The Weasley brothers hated the summer holidays more.\nPercy was the best friend the brothers had. Hermione had fooled around with Harry because they both remembered the end of their sixth year at Hogwarts. Harry had tricked Malfoy into doing more than he previously seemed intent on doing, and the letter dropping in the Graveyard (when Percy was under house arrest) had given Malfoy away. Harry was using his position as a  Hogwarts teacher and somewhere between that point and the end of their sixth years he was planning to kill Snape to further his own goals. They were noted for sniping at each other worryingingly whenever Harry got distracted.\n\nMalfoy had abducted Percy and put all the students in a dungeon beneath Lake Hurston in his school. With the help of Granger, Ron, Neville and Peverell, they'd devised a bait-trap for Harry to sneak into Snape's office. By the time Snape\u2019s protective bubble had completely changed, Harry had answered the door - and Snape was cornered. He had no choice but to kill the Dark Marked student, whom he had kidnapped, as the parents of the Dark Marked creature."}

{"text": "Reading text with other people can be an art, so knowing how to write a summary with verbatim passages can be quite valuable. Here are five tips we could use to write a better summary:\n\n1. Use words that describe the trees rather than the text. Using words like \"pine tree\" or \"oak tree\" will help you describe the trees clearly,\n2. Limit the text to one page at a time. A formal summary can go up to ten pages, which lets you get a sense of the tree's age, the condition of the tree at any given time, and help organize your thoughts around the text.\n3. Text should make sense in context - focus on the important parts of the text and remove irrelevant items. If you're just getting started with writing, formal writing is difficult, so finding critical pieces and arranging them neatly can help often.\n4. Take your time. Doing so will help you feel less distracted and able to focus on the important discussion.\n5. Keep your notes short and simple. The summary should be 140 characters or less - your edit time might otherwise be too long!"}

Mr. Webster took exception to this forced transfer of Indian land, but before long was reviled as a heretic and denounced by friends and enemies alike for his abject obedience to the cruel verdict. Nevertheless there is little in the Circa 1833 history to suggest that Webster experienced some setback since declaring that there was no \"warrant of claim\" to tribal lands, and therefore no Cherokee Indians to be removed--except for the few who did not refuse.

Household, physical, and mental factors often play a role in determining when one begins to develop a Type 1 or Type 2. People with advanced stages of this condition who have no symptoms during their first year are referred to as mild type 1, whereas those who have similar but lesser symptoms do not have a history of disease and are often referred to as mild type 2. Most people with a history of 1 type of diabetes are vegans or people of any other lifestyle, and people who have high blood pressure are also far less likely to develop Type 2. Other factors linked to risk of developing hypoglycemic hyperglycemic disorder include Zanetti's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects immune cells that are involved in the body's biological mechanisms of diabetes. People with this disorder display genetic variations that lead to other substantial health issues (such as seizures), and individuals with Zanetti's syndrome carry some of the symptoms of Type 1 diabetes, such as frequent urination, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, although these symptoms are uncommon among controls and those with less severe backgrounds."}

There are several reasons to consider this alternative.\n\nFor one, the British Emergency Broadcast System experienced several power outages between 1978 and 1988. Had the confidence that the system would be operational and able to handle the additional transmission volume, many UK households experienced isolated outages between 3 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. to keep up with the required programming. In addition, the prominence and choice of artists that The New Music featured made it a popular target for punch-ups. Coors was a major partner of the programme, and many celebrities were required to appear as pay-walls. If one were to immediately compare events before and after the introduction of Max Headroom, they would likely differ; however, this would require consideration beyond this.\n\nThe second alternative consideration is whether Max Headroom first appeared either on Channel 4 or in Coke ads. Given the prominence that Max Headroom had in both the UK and American pop music scene, it makes sense that two of his earliest known appearances followed on Channel 4. Perhaps this was due to pressure from TV stations that wanted to promote the programme or producers concerned about seeing Headroom become a household name"}

If these are only trace away broken pieces, you can more easily step back into the event from the visually represented pieces.

Braun published his Photogenic drawing or heliographic process in 1842, which required only an ordinary camera as the source of illumination. This was followed by Daguerre's d 'Photochemical processes in the photochemistry of mummies.'  It takes 30 minutes of exposure to produce visible pictures using just a regular camera.  The current process requires only 1 minute of exposure.  Physical scientists are still finding applications for longer exposure times and using visible light (light hitting the exposed skin) as decisive conditions rather than chemical exposures (photochemistry). \n2. Braun published his teaching methods in 1847, in which the supposed source of illumination was sunlight. This led to Daguerre's photochemistry, which is still in use today.  It takes seperate individual exposure times beyond 1 minute to produce the visible images called 'cylinders.' \n3. A lamp made out of wood or equivalent material can be used as the source of illumination, particularly in places where it is hot daylight and very dark, such as mines.\n4.

{"text": "Before making a sandwich, you'll need to prepare the bun, make the sandwich and then add some mustard and pickles. Then, take a look at the 'after' picture. You will be in the 'before' state. Firstly remove the bun and put the sandwich in a bowl of cold water. You'll then be able to see the characteristics of the sandwich once you're done - the shape is the same, the condiments do not have a significant effect on the quality of the sandwich. Now cut the sandwich and toss it into the bowl of cold water again to ensure it has a fresh coat of mustard and onions. Twist the top of the sandwich so that the outside, which is heavily marinated, is exposed and the outside pockets look dark against the bright white walls of the bowl. Once the remains of the patty are exposed, brush the perimeter of the sandwich lightly with your hand after each twist so that the patty grabs the edge of the bowl easily. Patience is key to success: the first few attempts the sandwich will wilt without moving, but seek assistance on lifting the sandwich onto the plate towards the kitchen. Cook a couple of minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit and then serve. To make the sandwich more appealing, sprinkle on some additional lettuce."}

Thus, the 'place the pan' order is not necessarily the order in which the instructions should be performed. However, this order would be different for humans: humans will often use 'place' to mean a direction, whereas processor translates that to temporally move toward a direction with stimulus. Thus, rearranging this order would not change the outcome of the task.\n\nBecause association to the previously stated order is not forced, we can apply the same trick to reconstruct the instructions. The processor still needs to execute the addition operation after performing the operation described here, and the processor knows that it will be delayed. As a result, it will assign new instructions. However, to ensure correctness, we should not assign incorrect instructions.\n\nTherefore, you should carefully consider your order of operations when performing this"}

In contrast, extinct hominins like P. afarensis and Lucy had significantly longer upper limbs (5 m) that made them both more human-like and incapable of hunting.\n3. The recent research suggests that this difference may be related to our selective advantages as hunters and gatherer over other primate species.\n4. It remains unclear, however, why the short arm advantage was absent in either Australopithecus africanus or P. afarensis. It may have been a problem for them in the face of a scarce food supply, pressure from predators, or simply a genetic mutation that eliminated the advantage.\n5. Lucy's lower arm length may have developed from her short arms, which may have been advantageous given her lower body size. Alternatively, it could have developed from a different lineage, such as P. reticulata, whose lower arm length was exacerbated by the needs of feeding and cold training."}

Humans, on the other hand, are kind and cooperative, spending time and energy tending to crops and pets. Humans and animals form societies and cooperate to reach consensus on what is in nature, so it is only natural that they would share knowledge and facilities.\n\nHumans process information from animals to guide social behavior. If you gaze upon a honey bee, pollen and nectar from the bee also function as inputs to guide social behavior. This is not abnormal for a bee which lives in an animal-like state. Bees establish hives with other insects on their behalf.\n\nTherefore, the only reason we have confirmation of the existence of Soil in the original text nor that bees can function in this fashion is because of the presumed influence of bees."}

While many biologists shared the views of many other scientists regarding the validity of the theory, many theological scholars regarded it with skepticism.\n4. Darwin had envisioned a mechanism in which natural selection would radically modify the way organisms reproduced, leading eventually to improved versions of the species. However, he lacked direct experimental evidence to support this mechanism.\n5. Many biologists similarly criticized the theory for imposing a priori explanations, such as Darwin disproven evolution prematurely.[citation needed]\n6.

Prediction is a risky strategy, as it depends on implicit knowledge of events, and relies on subjective cues of when and how events might take place. Impartial forecasting (known as Simulated History) could reduce these risks because events could be overestimated or underestimate, so storing information that evolves over time might become irrelevant.

{"text": "The simple step is straightforward. Just mix ingredients together. The mixture should be somewhat thicker than the pan and warm up until it's warm enough to touch. Once the mixture is warm, turn the oven up to 350 degrees and remove it from the heat. The sugar content should be about the same as the ingredients, but for simplicity, use very small amounts. Next, flour can be added and the batter becomes dry -- add the flour mixture and stir. Finally, the corners of the pan are dough. These are not particularly intimidating, but you will need to mentally visualize your bowl and unpick the dough. \n\nThis remains your dough in the bowl when you eventually cut with a knife. After cutting, cut out and wrap the dough with baking paper. This might feel counterintuitive, but the goal is to wrap the dough around the knife so it forms a wedge.

Yelp similarly uses nearby Bing algorithms to determine each Yelp review's popularity.[31] The sites gathers feedback from multiple sources including reader impressions, reviews of local businesses and other sources. Yelp then negotiates difficult conditions such as not accepting reviews with overly low score, or reviews which contain highly negative feedback. Yelp has been criticized for skewing the results in favor of the brand, customer reviews and business metrics.[32] Similar to its mass consumer purchase program (see Purchase Solution) Yelp offers unlimited options to members, but only a small sample of reviews; a small sample seen as detrimental.[33] Yelp is cited as a hated brand with negative review volume amongst its reviews.[ 34] Finally, reviews often contain \"spam, affiliate links, stolen content, poor quality, irrelevant reviews, and accidents\".[ 35] Yelp is subject to hacks which redirect visitors to their own fraudulent reviews, or offer fraudulent phone numbers and other fraudulent credentials.[36"}

People who consume more fiber have a lower incidence of heart disease and may help avoid the development of heart diseases in the first place.\n\nAccording to the study, participants were 494 people with a frequency ranging from 1000 to 50000 and were followed up for a median of 20 years. During baseline, participants completed questionnaires about diet (2 quarts/week, less than 300 grams) and lifestyle (not attending a clinic more than once/week for more than 30 days in a row, residing in the same residential area for at least 3 years, and never smoking). Throughout the follow-up visits, participants also completed questionnaires about cholesterol (1) and blood pressure (BP). Some of the variables participants completed as baseline were also analyzed later (at baseline and at the follow-up visits). The results suggest that people who consumed more fiber have a lower prevalence of heart disease and may avoid the development of heart disease, in part, because they consume less saturated fat and consume less cholesterol.\n\nPeople consuming higher amounts of fiber have been shown to have a lower incidence of many types of heart disease, including: high cholesterol"}

While the collection's immense success drop off Hasselblad's share from No. 1 to No. 27, Paid streaming for Young Thug Bum's tracks \"Goodbyes\" and \"Limitless\" vaulted beyond the album's second half and led Toppers rapper Nicki Minaj to suggest the entire album was his personal birthright. Many attributed the chaotic nature of the collection's subsequent decline, largely driven by Thug's dramatic dropout, to excessive streaming, attributed in part to the rapper's aversion to exploitation via streaming platforms such as Google Play and Apple Music, which led to his dropping other artists entirely (Khaled was similarly dropped by Forbes on \u201cProblems Deepening!\u201d).

The line is too long.\nHe didn't have enough time to buy a ticket.\n\nWhy is this grammatical?\nThe English language has many grammatical rules that are specific to its speakers. These rules can help us understand and reason about writing in the English language. Our job is to follow these rules and provide the sentence we need in order to complete the task.\n\nThe rules for proper punctuation (\"at the beginning of a word\", for example) are contained in the Oxford English Dictionary. The rules for proper sentence punctuation are also contained in the Oxford English Corpus, which is a compendium of grammatical rules based on the English spoken in 17th century England. These rules are generally used adverbs, adjectives, and verbs. For example, all verbs should use the preposition \"was\", while adjectives should use the possessive pronoun \"were\".\n\nThe proper punctuating rule is often followed in the writing of spoken sentences. For example, the following two sentences are both straightforward sentences with simple grammatical structure:\nAlex wants to go to the cinema when her mother says she has something important to do. \nShe wants to go to the theatre when her"}

If there are multiple restaurants in a neighborhood with the same name, the owner may share the highest number of Micheline stars with only one of those restaurants in the neighborhood. The idea is to use SQL queries to combine all of these restaurants with the appropriate number of Micheline stars in order to get an overall average rating. In this example, the total number of restaurants is 4, so we can use the SQL command  AverageRatings[1] to get a rough estimate of the average number of Michelin stars in the neighborhood. In this example, total RatedSpecies / 4 restaurants is reported as 41, since a Michelin star is divided by 4. Given that 1 Michelin star is 1,323, this would give us 11 restaurants which have the highest average Micheline levels. This is good for selecting 8 southeast Asian restaurants with averages of 28, since these restaurants have 1,323 restaurants spread among the 8. We can combine this line of reasoning with another kind of analogy, which can be written as AverageMichelinStarLevels[2]. For example, we could split the line up by Street, Area, and Miche"}

Different types of rewards (fluffy pellets) are available to the rat for different behavioral tasks. For example, the lever-press or intermittent-flip behavior is enhancers of lever pressing. Pellets can be selected during preratings in which their actual duration of availability is unknown. Some of the experimental manipulations consisted of selecting the correct lever to press and providing the rodents with a pellet, in which case the rat pressed the lever as though the mouse had pressed the correct lever during the previous session. Evidence of the intermittent-flip behavior was apparent in some experimental designs, when the rodent would skip the initial (obvious) reinforcer and begin a \"flip\" actual (i.e. inactive) session instead, from the rat's first session.\n\nThe addition of water to the rat's prior sessions enabled them to practice lever pressing during their observed and artificially delayed sessions (i.e. during their preratings), without learning the previously learned behavior. Thisineffect was realized through multiple experimental manipulations (or alternations of reinforcers and non-reinforcers) in which the rats were"}

Ho Chi Minh City is also one of the top destinations around Ho Chi Minh, a city that is situated on a peninsula overlooking the adjacent ocean. It's always been challenging walking around Saigon, but I've never been here, and so I feel like I'm in a mobile game."}

For this delicious taco, most people will opt to cook them to a black bean tortilla. A perfectly cooked black bean can become a tasty chipotle sweet potato chip. Next, is your chili powder, chili powder. This can be found online, in competitive stores like Amazon, or at home delivery. Some basic guidelines for chili powder usage include: powder size - 1/2 teaspoon, so 1 tablespoon can be used.  Method of making chili powder - Combine 1 tablespoon chopped up cilantro, shredded shiitake mushrooms, brown sugar, and chili powder in a bowl.  Don't forget to add a pinch pinch kosher salt. Chili recipes from the internet include the famous 'Chili Reaper' from Tacos Milam, as well as the Brazilian 'Tacos Hummus' variation."}

In order to scramble egg, you will need two stationery utensils (such as a stand mixer or dutch oven), two eggs, and flour.

To scramble egg, you will first rub flour over three eggs, and slowly stir the mixture around until dough forms. While the mixture is combined, flip two eggs and rub again until they are fully mixed. Look for a portion of dough that doesn't stick to the spoon, and begin kneading it using your hands to secure it.

There are multiple techniques you can employ, but the most important one is the use of visual filters. A good starting point is to use a textured filter on the items your mind is drawn to. Sometimes called an \"anaphoric\" filter, this filter changes the image of an item when a viewing it through a different filter. For example, a exposure changing the visual filter from blue to green makes the item seem more round and vibrant. If you do this consistently, you can start to get some of the desired effect. Another useful technique is to make a list of items and then select one among them by its textured filter."}

When she succeeded in avoiding sadness, she was ecstatic, but also frustrated. The scene was becoming more surreal, as she was running away from a thought that could not be realized. She scolded herself for not being more creative and for not being more creative."}

{"text": "In this task you're given two strings of letters: \"a\", \"a\" and \"ac\". You need to find the number of distinguishable substrings in both of the strings.\n\nThe clue in the output is that the number of distinct common strings is 4. Substraction of 1 produces the number 4, which is 4. Substraction (length of strings) of 2 and 3 produces the number 4, and 1 and 3 are the same thing, so you can substitute 1 into 4 without issue, as long as you want one string to have length 2 and 3). Not all numbers are digits, so you need to use a fractional binomial in your search to sort the strings (a divided by 2 is 4/4, a divided by 3 is 3/3, and a divided by 2 is 4). Therefore, the number of distinct strings is 4."}

The subsequence that does not contain the starting n characters is called an empty string. Therefore, if you want to generate a subsequence from x without touching the starting n characters, you would remove all the characters from the first sequence generating a list of strings of length n, where n is the length of the string starting from 0, which is 5. Therefore, to generate a single string of length 5 without touching the starting n, you would replace the starting n with the sequence n repeatedly removing characters from the first until you reach the length of the last sequence; where n is the length (n + 1) of the last sequence generated. An empty string removes all characters from the list applying the mapping rule that it can never contain exactly 5 sequences - i.e. 5 x, 5 x, n. Further, an empty string never completes generating the string - it never completes generating the string at all."}

This is because the machine learning model has no way to identify which words are words that were published previously. They simply do not have sufficient power to remove these words from the corpus and only show that they were removed due to in-place training. The goal of this training set up is to train the model to understand keyword intent from reviews without actually seeing any words in the text. \n\nNote the redundancy. There is only one word that removes all of these words which makes a removal much more difficult. This word is the identifier of keyword words in the text. Therefore, for a given keyword word, removing words that match the keyword word fixes the score of removing all of these words. The work is actually very similar to what people\u2019s reaction to a newspaper article when multiple pieces of information are conflicting. If all of the information in the article is accurate, the article will have a high \"confidence\" rating.

So, to avoid any pitfalls in my approach, I rented a cab from a nearby pizzeria; which, when at the same time facing a limited menu, offered buttery small plates! What could go wrong? Nope, love it! We knew it too: after ordering, we were immediately turned onto a store class pasta sign, introducing us to the list of recommended toppings for the pasta. Next, we were given quintessentially Italian risotto, which turned out so excellent that this review can be called a winner. Lesson learned: for beautiful, but sophisticated  Italian cuisine, we visit Schiaparelli style pizzerias - which is kind of a tougher sell. Finally, my bladder froze! My daughter was very sheepish and politely waited, opting to try the dessert - the avocado pad.  However, three minutes into her meal after consuming the delicious offering of dill and chia seeds - the restaurant abruptly changed table for the pearl silk tea at"}

The third item is protein, which comprises 17% of the total calories. Therefore, protein is exactly 200 grams. Therefore, in this example, the serving size of the \"bread\" is 500 grams. The total calories contained in the bread would thus be 200 - 500 + 20 + 30 = 216 grams. For example, if the recommended serving size of a 5 piece meal consists of only 200 grams of protein, 500 grams of bread (containing 70% of the daily recommended serving size) would be consumed. This also assumes that the 5 piece meal items are not mixed, so the remainder of the calories (20% of the total) are unable to be consumed. For example, although you are given 200 grams of carbohydrates, you might consume 5 slices of whole-grain bread (containing 70% the daily recommended serving size, and with the other 20% of the calories derived from total protein)."}

{"text": "Ideally, you would cluster the data into subsets. The easiest way to do that would be to start with a single sample and see which cluster emerges as the best fit. Then, you could combine the subsets by averaging the performance of the clusters.\nThe next logical step would be to see which \u201cbest fit\u201d cluster is the most familiar to you. Only then would you be able to identify which cluster is the best fit for your question. From there, identifying which cluster has the greatest power to benefit the dataset. On average, best fitting clusters consist of clusters near the top and below the median, but closer to the middle and bottom of the distribution. \n\nFor more complex questions, you can consider outliers but predicting the cluster bias on any epoch is challenging without some knowledge of the previous datasets. Starting with a single sample of 1000 and distributed across all your subsets could miss some data that is more specific to the question.\n\nA number of techniques can be used to generate a \"best fit\" \u201cbest fit\u201c - either by finding a set of facts at a particular time points and dividing them in panels, or by simply taking a subjective statement, 2,500 words long and splitting it into chunks."}

Note that type patterns written in a book or on a website cannot be reproduced, so don't stress too much if the patterns look different.  \nNext, try the following: try hyping the event by typing'my favorite' or'my favorite subject' followed by the occurrence of the word.   You should gain some speed by hyping it particularly rapidly before the subject or event.   \nDo these small fixes improve your typing speed or help you learn a new typing technique?

While we all know that writing reviews is easy and we can avoid spending time conducting actual reviews (yet another reason why Yelp is the best service), I think the author excels at writing more coherently, and that the review provided fits more neatly into the neutral category. Let me explain: Whenever I write a review on Yelp, I'm first reviewing the restaurants/cateries/anything-that-came-into my vicinity.\n\nThe downside to Yelp isn't so much that I can no longer use the service; it's that I'm now feeling the pressure to cater to a customer base that may not already exist. I tried to cater to what I thought my customers were interested, but I'm not so much off of the hook as to necessarily generate new customers. Ultimately, all I can do is provide the currently existing and presumably satisfied customers with a product that may or may not be particularly high in quality. \n\nThe neo-Neutralism Much argument has been made against Yelp; its dominance causes competitors to feel left out and thus resort to more efficient and creative techniques to increase their platform visibility.

For example, Yelp will go from awarding a \"5 star\" review for the Kurtz Brewing Co. to awarding a score of \"0 stars\" if there are no reviews for this location at all. However, if there are reviews for the bartender, counter management, general staff, and even one room at the house, the unique rewards of an adaptive and nuanced review system will be lost.

For example, Trump has made baseless charges against the families of campaign associates, treating his own Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, as a \"pig,\" and encouraging his government to violate basic norms of influence within US institutions.\n\nThe violence directed at police officers carries with it a reminder of the dictatorial tendencies of Trump himself and a voting record that has fostered especially fascistic tendencies among his supporters.

A simple pattern recognition task, you are given a sequence of 3 consecutive ASCII letters, and are required to match the first and last token of each sequence to determine the second.

If a pattern is not within that set, it just searches the random subset of classes that include it.\n\nTo use the quick brown fox trick, I would use the first digit of the clue to sort through the alphabet of the mystery text with the class I want; otherwise I would first pick a token at random and grab the subsequence of all the other characters that all have 1, then search backwards until I find a match.

{"text": "An extract, transform and load (ETL), business intelligence (BI) and a data mining component are components in a data warehouse system. An extract provides summary information for all of the entities in the data warehouse, especially in the form of key-value pairs and schemas, as well as data related to the entities.\n\nTo allow the users to use that summary information to perform work for the BI system, the extract and transform components are often combined into a BI Data Pipeline. These components work together to route data into the appropriate table or pipeline, and beginning with BI Data Warehouse 2013, updates from the BI data pipeline are intelligently incorporated as part of the model.\n\nWhile all of this might seem like complex workflows, exactly the opposite is true. Once you start learning what's involved, the scope of these workflows quickly broadens: you start reaching into data scrapers and scraping databases of course, but handle this information ingestion and transform the data; you load the various components for the BI workflows and build up technologies to ingest and transform the data, but you don't spend much time managing the process of loading and processing that data at the first try.\n\nIn Summary, there are three main components in a data warehouse systems: Extract,"}

Bulk cooking destroys nutrients, enzymes and vitamins.  Cooking potatoes IMMEDIATELY will render those nutrients useless for humans.  We eat them straight from the pot, which is rare because most of the rare metals are often extracted from potatoes.  Frying potatoes  then eliminates vitamins nearly as effectively.  COOKED potatoes should be cooked until soft so that damage is minimised.  In a pinch, a knife can be used to snip and discard the skin.

{"text": "FACT: Dogs and cats are highly trained and well-regarded by many organizations for their part in animal rescue. It is quite common for animals to survive in extremely rough conditions before finding homes. These animals are often left abandoned on the streets or in the wild for whoever has no other choice but to take them in because animals that feature in the desire of those who purport to rescue them are also abandoned. Most of these animals end up in sanctuaries and often suffer.\nCritics claim that these organizations profit from animal cruelty, as they are only inspiring rescue organizations. But what about those who actually cause the suffering? I can understand that dogs and cats can become attached and aggressive towards people, but is this caused by institutionalized use of force or the need to breed more animals? Perhaps the worst abuse happens out of jams. Future generations, if left to their own devices, may not understand what they are missing. My son used to complain about herding dogs, but herding dogs is not the only reason why she had to leave.  Dogs often show aggression towards those who attempt to abuse them; likewise, if you are treating pets as disposable commercial commodities, you shouldn't abandon them to fend for themselves."}

A popular cookbook called Easy Cooking by James Beard teaches us that natural food and easy care methods can produce delicious and nutritious results. I believe the recipes demonstrate the practice of meticulous, science-oriented preparation. The recipes for this recipe are helpful to quickly and easily prepare chicken by putting most of the pieces into a bowl and then submerging them in the hot water for 30 seconds to 1 minute. I like to make three chicken breasts. To start with, I'll take a bowl of water, rinse the chicken, then cut up the chicken into very thin strips. Then you're ready to lay the chicken - the quickest way to cut into the chicken is with a knife. Upon purchase, I'll pour the water into the bowl to foam it; under the water, put the chicken to the side of the pan; and skim one side of the chicken to coat it with the water. Once the water is hot, pour the chickens halves into the bowl. From there, flip"}

Overall rating from a review: This is the most important aspect for reviews, since it reflects how high the business owner's rating is on Yelp.\n2. Side note: How do you determine which reviews represent real-estate interests? Niche reviews are usually recommendations based on reviews from friends and neighbours. Once identified as a concern, business owners try to address the problem.\n3. Price: Depending on the restaurant, different items usually require multiple reviews. Therefore, the subjective nature of reviews can lead to inaccurate impressions of the restaurant.\n4. Change of ownership: Depending on the business, new ownership often presents other challenges. Some may wish to take ownership for competitive reasons (e.g., serving the best sushi) or business reasons such as profitability or growth (e.g., growing revenue).\nBelow are some suggestions for improving reviews and incorporating these suggestions into your review process.\n1. Perform basic keyword research on reviews. Yelp can show you the important details about reviews, which can help you filter reviews based on these parameters.\n2.

These fast-track laws enable any government to pass \"pensions\", environmental laws and spending bills without parliamentary scrutiny.

Thus, when the Lib Dems were forced to vote against coalition agreement to fund these priorities, their votes went largely to keep these anti-austerity laws in place.\n\nLet me be very clear: the Lib Dems voted against fast track legislation when we were strongly in favour of fast track legislation. But they refrained from voting against it when we were opposed. Tim Farron understands this and acted on it. Nicole Collins (leader of the Lib Dems) has publicly claimed that \"fast track\" acts sabotage local control of the economy. If so, to blame Tim Farron for our party's slow performance is an argument that has no merit. Tim Farron faced a choice between allowing his party to take votes purely on fast track or next to none. His choice is both illusory - cut short our movement's reach, and throw promises for local control in the trash stream"}

That party's Patrick Lowe and James Walsh won the second count, but not from the first count.\n\nThese points are crucial to understanding how relatively low turnout was in 2013 and how a high proportion of votes for both candidates went in the Labour Party's favour.\nHowever, Ms Bourne tells us she did not use her extra savings to fund the election campaign, simply to increase her vote tally. She simply won the election in 2012 and hadn't put any amount of extra money towards the campaign until 2013. Thus, the 3 points made by the text and the outcomes they represent do not correspond with the actual turnout in 2013 and explain the low voter turnout."}

I ended up going to sleep at 3pm because it was a clear night and I felt that I should be awake by 6:30am.\n\nTaking a nap in between sleep periods is generally discouraged because it can interfere with your circadian rhythm (morning light and fall asleep simultaneously), therefore can interfere with your schedule for working out (rest hard and wake up late), and can lead to sleep deprivation, which is one of the causes of many functional disorders and chronic fatigue in modern humans. However, you cannot control the nature of the events under consideration. I had an argument with a friend of mine yesterday and she decided to try random shuffling. We initially tried it using a simple word-swapping trick by writing out a sentence word by word, starting with the first word, shuffle. The result was a coherent sentence with unpleasant legal phrases, such as \"he sleepwalked into a fight with his partner.\" I disagreed, and the word was the shuffled sentence \"he became upset when he saw his ex-girlfriend cheating on him\".

It is analogous to observing a water wave: when waves interact with each other -- photons interact with a slits and get their waveforms from the interference patterns seen when waves interact with one another. The latter example would be similar to studying a wave by throwing a light beam through a water wave: you would see waves in the middle -- light emanating from a single atom or state -- but also see waves trilaterally split into two separate strands, such as a column of waves.\n\nThe double-slip experiment is also used to test the validity of fundamental assumptions about quantum gravity: Einstein's relativity theory predicted rigid bodies like galaxies require objects in space to behave like waves in behaving like waves. In our universe, it appears that the lightWe (photons) do here buck signals on the signal waves (photons). If we interpret the two waves as being closed in on each other, the behavior of galaxies can be retested.\n\nThere are more than 50 compounds that may exhibit binding of light and its behavior as waves."}

The UK has a lot of leverage gained by staying in the single market and the customs union even though not all members of the single market will benefit from benefits accrued to them. The UK could use this leverage fairly easily to influence the negotiating agenda, but the UK would be missing many of the beneficial trade outcomes gained from co-production in and access to the single market and the single market.\nSadly, the report goes further into details on how the UK government might not deliver on its objectives by leaving the single market without clear clarity and clarity on how it will proceed."}

In order to compute the sum of the two elements, we must first sort the array, so we must first sort the target array. However, changing the order of the array inputs will change the target number. We can simply replace our order of the integers with floats, which is a faster operation. The next step is to sort the array using the bspline algorithm. Given the order of the inputs, bspline can be used directly on the array, increasing its efficiency by dividing the size of the batch sequence by an additional factor. Here, we order the input to bspline by the number of elements we want to find, so bspline can find the first element in the output sequence of the algorithm. This is equivalent to changing the target number from 1 to 10, since 1 is the first element in the input sequence and 10 is the last element. Finally, we can use bspline to sort the array using a fixed cutoff value of 0.5."}

Thus we can first shuffle the array, then calculate the ordered values, then compare the resulting order with the positive and negative values, then order the values in the positive to negative range. However, this may be more complicated than performing the steps described here.\n\nIt is also possible to use neural networks for the search algorithm. Examples of applications include: machine translation, natural language understanding, voice generation, natural language spoken classification, natural language sentiment detection, and high-dimensional machine translation.\n\nUntil recently, the pandas library was the primary implementation of neural networks for working with large arrays. The important difference comes when working with large arrays, where dense models with strong dependencies are crucial. The pandas library offers a stable and efficient implementation, which is also intuitive because it cuts down on the number of steps to learn how to apply the network. We could also consider a Connect package written in R, but only suitable for the development of custom architectures, for which use cases often have fewer dependencies."}

At the same time, advances in treatments for all diseases -- including Alzheimer's and the prevention of certain types of cancer like oral cancer and breast cancer -- have dramatically accelerated their progress in recent years.\nSome scientists believe the structural cause of such rapid progress lies in a biological process known as mitochondrial dysfunction, which is also impacted by mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria are ubiquitous species in the bacterial and animal kingdom and likely play a role in the neurodegenerative process.\n\nIt's been thought that formation of amyloid plaques (APIs) was a key automatic protection mechanism against these hyperproliferative diseases, but now scientists have linked mitochondrial dysfunction to a far more insidious phenomenon: mitochondrial receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, a critical mechanism downstream of whose toxicity results from the aforementioned mtDNA mutations.\n\n\"Although the mechanism of APIs remains largely uncertain, an accumulating body of evidence shows that mitochondria and their adjacent tangles, repetitively linked within macrophages to mitochondria (plasmacytoins),\" said Craig Venter, the George E.

{"text": "The Germans invaded Russia in 1941. Their invasion of the Soviet Union in 1939 had them completely encircled in Europe and with it, Hitler had no other options but to resort to war. The invasion of Poland in 1940 had Hitler's army aware that an ally had appeared and thus encouraged them to take further actions. In April 1942, Hitler's forces crossed the channel and engaged the French and Italians in a brutal and bloody battle which spanned European history. This defeat had Hitler and his allies reduced to a minority in power by the Allies dropping their pretense of global leadership. Hitler became convinced that he had been beaten and had nothing left to lose. However, he had run out of options and had no choice but to act. Hitler sent Field Marshal Ernst Rohm to orchestrate a coup and install his own trusted replacement, General Kurt Georg Kieff. Ultimately, Hitler managed to overthrow the government and his allies. However, the loss of European pride still haunts him deeply and it drove him to commit war crimes, furthering his personal ambitions. A second coup attempt failed in July 1943 where members of the Nazi party returned to power. However, offloading this leadership failed and Hitler was no longer in a position to flex his leadership muscles. He had lost both the will"}

This includes everything from mines extracting gold, copper, nickel, and other metals, to refineries and factories that process vegetables, fruits, fish, and other plants.

Between February and June this year, 9.3% of the Police\u2019s referrals into the Criminal Justice Acter were handling online harassment cases, or 476,000 cases. This is an increase of 47.5% from the 15% recorded in the police recorded crime statistics for the same period in 2016. The worrying trend is consistent with other research, which concludes that traditional digital communications, such email, communication on social media or visiting the internet to access crime information, are more dangerous for someone to pursue than non-digital forms of communication such as watching films or playing online games. These practices of trolling known online referrers can pose a high threat to individual safety, due to the anonymity built into the anonymity of internet communication.

{"text": "Customer dissatisfactions with department store chains, such as long lines at checkout counters, are largely attributed to long checkout lines at the store and poor service. Under these circumstances, unhappy customers may turn to substituting other methods of payment such as cashier checks for credit cards. In turn, customers become less inclined to shop in the store and consequently spend their cash on merchandise that does not exist. In addition, this decrease in shopping activity may cause other stores across the chain to drop their stock, threatening the profitability of the department store chain. In this case, a customer exodus may occur, leaving little money for the other stores across the chain that still have cash on hand. This leads to a depreciating industry with fewer customers, which may reduce profitability of the entire business.\n\nAnother cause which may drive customer dissatisfaction may be the introduction of a new product or process, including volume pricing. Since many customers are new to the store, they tend to be unfamiliar with the quality of the product at hand or its relative quality within the given model of the store. Therefore, they may be less satisfied with the store or the services it offers despite the product. Additionally, customers may simply be unaware of this issue, thereby avoiding an investigation into the underlying cause."}

Some argue that wild dogs represent a threat to their way of life and they are showing no signs of abating.\n\nA drastic change is happening.  As people become owners of dogs, dogs are becoming prey and that must change for them.  With more and more people becoming pet owners, the environment is becoming more dangerous for dogs as new apartment buildings and other developments have been constructed with cars and civilians inside. Dogs therefore present a challenge to pet owners. In the end, however, many owners find joy in their pets and they maintain their right to hunt or kill them for sport, if they so choose.\n\nDespite the challenges we are finding ourselves in, we mustn't lose sight of the inherent goodness in humans and their ability to care.

Reading this paragraph makes one think to themselves to ensure your children watch the show Neighbor when they're little, because you or someone of authority should be able to assure someone with a power of arrest to watch The Sopranos, a popular HBO show right before their birth. If the author of this piece meant anything other than that later, she has forgotten what television is actually like.\n\nThe study also provides evidence of connection between TV viewing and early death, which brings us to the second headline at hand. It claims that the mere amount of television watched is linked to an increased likelihood of dying in your lifetime. Of course, this might be true, based on the flawed science, it does not distinguish between TV viewers and those who do not.\n\nAbove, we see that \"early death\" is connected to either continuous TV viewing, or people who watch one hour of television per day (exercise, bad eating habits) not for lack"}

Additionally, with the challenges of industrial farming for food that is subject to pesticides and highly regulated, many proponents of genetically modified food believe that ethical concerns about contamination are largely overcome by using technology that alters the genetic code to make the food more accessible to those with mutations without causing an adverse effect on the health of the host."}

{"text": "There is conflicting evidence on this topic. For one, there is weak empirical support from the Animal Behaviour Lab that video games lead to aggression. And the general consensus among neurobiologists is that psychological mechanisms can be involved in the development of aggression, causing the brain to become more aggressive or less aggressive. Therefore, addressing the issue by simply asking people to rate how aggressive they feel toward a virtual enemy to see if they would feel more or less aggressive toward the video game as a means of understand ing it.\n\nHowever, in a comment on this piece from a professor of gaming at Cambridge University, Dr. Zoe Saldana, seems to imply that people who play video games are now \"hyper-aggressive\", seeking to outdo their opponents. In her words, \"Video games enable us to play increasingly larger and more complex, more aggressive roles, and the resulting environment fosters deficiencies in our decision-making, reasoning and memory.\" Reasons for hyper-aggression include poor instruction, unfair competition and limited choice. Moreover, despair appears to increase in virtual communities, leading players to lash out at their opponents, leading to new games and skills being developed that reflect that despair.
