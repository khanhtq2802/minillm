The tea becomes hot enough to start leaching some of the gingery substance from the inside and the popped tea leaves are now steaming, but not so hot that they fully vaporise on contact. The steam from the boiling tea releases the hot sugar, which absorbs some of the steam which then escapes into the hot water - its behaviour changes, and the steaming starts to make the sugar flake out of the cup and get drip - but the tea retained some of the gingency. The cup steams hot enough to vaporise into steam that it starts to leak from the edge, releasing some of the sugar from the tea. The vapour gets released into the air and then it rotates back inside of the cup, spilling some of the tea liquid into the nearby chai."}

Both the physical restrictions against consuming certain foods and cultural taboos might influence how we treat animals outside of our immediate family -- restriction might make us stronger and less likely to kill them for their meat, freedom from social taboos might make us lazy and avoid trouble, and the lack of a culturally-based food taboo would make us feel bad about consuming non-restricted foods."}

Once we've established that the instructions are out of order, we can focus our attention on the 'treating the egg' or 'watershed' topic: returning the egg to the fridge when the pan is inverted. This topic is therefore entirely optional but perfectly sensible as it denatures and reduces oxidation in the egg.

There were various geology conditions that undermined the likelihood of finding the oil quickly, making further work difficult.  Additionally, the extraction method used might also be less reliable due to different formations and geological settings, making it more difficult to determine when to stop extracting.  While there is evidence that performing exploratory drilling early might have proven profitable, fewer resourceful people have subsequently explored the area, and finding the oil there might not have been economically viable. Finally, the area is remote and official land boundaries are ambiguous. Bodies of oil that might contain drilling mud have been found, but no geologists have located definitive results indicating"}

The second iteration is the result of incorporating the redundant updates into the reference, i.e., 'Empty the pot'.\n\nWhich of these steps makes sense by itself?

So when I say 'Likely', I really am saying that the possibility of Jack winning is equivalent to my probability of him winning plus the 10 guesses he would need to have to win the game. We can apply this to many different outcomes - suppose I had to guess 'Three dogs is a man's best friend'. My probability of he actually winning is zero since there are only 3 dogs in the game, and each of them would have to win at most one race. If he sweeps three out of these, he still needs 14 more guesses than he actually wins so he needs a probability of 1.\nThe interaction between probability and likelihood of outcome is known as Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) - the attributional mechanism.  We can formalize this by splitting probability into probability of a likely event, probability of an event occurring given the likelihood it also"}

If 'the man' can be compared to 'dog', one could argue that this is evidence of syntactic similarities (\u00e0 la Strong's 'dog-ness' vs. his 'weaknesses'). On the other hand, 'the dog' can be compared to similarly constructed adjectives (I'm both stronger and weaker than my sister) which show both concepts to have similar properties.

Since mathematics and computer science are mathematical and computer scientists are computer scientists, we can formulate a better mathematical algorithm than stating that a loop of well-defined instructions works reliably in all but true cases. In such a case, a well-defined mathematical algorithm can be optimized for work that passes a threshold for being considered statistical significance : it simply cannot work in all cases; therefore, it is called an automated algorithm. For example, efficient program implementations of the Loeb Classical Computation (LCPC) and MSLP Codebreaking Cryptography Algorithms (CSBE) can be discerned by their combination of formal and algorithmic description, despite their inherently poor statistical performance.

Assuming both the older and younger brother are alive, but without a developed form of neural link and as a result having different genetic makeup, the chances of both siblings being related essentially increase exponentially. It is not possible to know for sure what the older brother would look like or even how old he would be, but due to the very nature of human genetics, it is extremely unlikely that either of them would be related to another adult. Finally, the younger brother would likely be unaware of his brothers past, as they are likely to have come from different adoptive parents, raising vastly different sets of identical children which is why there might be many notable exceptions to DNA testing. If either brother does join the family, it is likely that they will be in a position to further strengthen their connections, leading to even stronger genetic and physical relationships."}

{"text": "Words can contain any number of words. For example'red', 'green', and 'blue' are words with different names. A word with multiple names'red', 'green' and 'blue' can all be valid. Therefore, a 'yes' answer to the question 'Is this rule a valid rule?' would say 'Yes'. A 'no' answer would say 'No'. Substraction of words in the text means that words are separated by spaces. Thus 'yes', 'no', 'yes', 'no' and 'yes reuse spaces'. Thus in the rule below,'red' has multiple amounts of spaces while 'green' has just one. By combining a plain word with multiple elements, such as a comma, we can create a separate word which uses the right combination of spaces: 'yes', 'no'. Thus 'yes', 'yes' and 'no' use spaces to separate words'red', 'green'."}

In either case, the baby dragon would probably be a very tiny, very tiny baby. Now multiply the predicted probabilities by 100. Assuming that the whole story is a lie, the probability that the man would find a baby dolphin in his backyard is 0.9999999999999, meaning that the baby would be alive and likely to have a pretty decent chance of survival. Still, to be quite realistic, the chances that the baby would survive the journey from Africa to Europe are astronomical, and would require a minimum of five decades of living. Given this, the chance of the baby surviving the African journey would be only 0.15% for every year that the baby is just a year old, making the average lifespan of an adult \"the chance of survival in one year\".

{"text": "Photosynthesis produces chemical energy by absorbing red, green, and blue light in different wavelengths, and converting it to chemical energy. It is the process of splitting water into two large pools in nature. Red light is absorbed actively and green light is stopped. Photosynthesis is largely active during the day, when sunlight bounces off of leaves and algae, and darkens the edges of plants. During the night, cells use electron transport to convert the electron energy into heat. The process continually creates chemical energy, which can be converted to chemical energy using light. A swimming bacterium called bacteriophage converts light into mechanical energy, called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). It converts red light directly to ATP, but requires light in either the red or green wavelengths. Photosynthesis is usually not active during the night because electron transport does not work well on water, and therefore chlorophyll absorbs and transfers the red light and converts it to chemical energy. Thermostat-generated nitric oxide undergoes oxidation and sulfur dioxide is released into the atmosphere."}

Many chefs, like Richard Vigoda from Italy, are famous for their exquisite desserts. Vigoda has made many famous seafood dishes. Topping his list of creating these exquisite dishes require a very specific education process and cooking of rare species.\n\nFor instance, Vigoda knows of some of the deeper sea species that require far more time, effort, knowledge, or education to cook. Thus, rather than simply stating the obvious real-world counterpart, he invokes the fantasy world of an upstanding sea chef. He opens his mouth and the golden globes come out.\n\nPast studies have shown that in certain areas \"great chefs\" are rewarded more for their expertise than those who are simply good at the art of cooking. In other words, to generalize from his landhouse observations, a \"highly regarded\" chef is rewarded more for their knowledge than the average chef who does not have that degree. Yet, this would not be the case for everyone. Some see this as evidence of a grind to scientific achievement whereas Vigoda and others with culinary training have gravitated to local culinary life."}

Another possibility is to use a wire trap that traps the chicken and its gizzards within a wire basket."}

In this case there are two possible flows of ingredients: one originating from the recipe itself (as in pouring milk into a glass to make pancakes) and the other arising from mixing them with the ingredients you are now using. The latter case is often possible because the properties of the raw milk usually give it a high fat and proteins content, particularly between foams and small lumps of milk.

If you use the word 'in proportion' to describe the Italian phrase 'in piet\u00e0 technic\u00e0,' for example, 1/2 = 1/2, you would be comparing apples (one apple) to oranges (two oranges). Although apples come in a quarter of the world (the vast majority), oranges are more than twice as numerous, so 1/2 is the same as 0.5 (0.25 * 0.25) and 1/2 is roughly 31% of another apple (0.25 * 3). Though oranges are larger than apples, they're only 1% larger, so 1/2 would be 0.5% less than 1/2. And 1/2 is misleading; 1/2 can mean different things at different times; 1/3 would be 0.25% less than 1/3, for example. So 1 is misleading and 0.5 is not; 1/2 refers to numbers that aren't exactly the same, and 1 doesn't have a corresponding number (1/3).\n\nIn fact, 'in proportion' is actually used a lot more than the other way around.

In either case, we need to consider further the potential health effects or risks that might emerge from changing the reproductive state of the egg which is still focused on motherhood rather than the survival of the young.

The order of the ingredients is important in order to avoid dish-ending issues where the dish requires the ingredients to be placed multiple times for it to be tasty. In order to make the dish as tasty as possible using ingredients that are roughly the same on both sides, you will want to use ingredients that are sold fresh (e.g., butter, milk) or in the fridge. To avoid this, you will want to make sure each ingredient has room for at least 3-4 hours in it, ideally up to a couple of hours. Many recipes offer additional instructions on how to prepare items in the fridge such as directions if you need them. You should also make sure the fridge is empty.

{"text": "Word1: Pain \nWord2: Pane \nWay back to basics, wordsyntax is important as you need to learn what is considered casual, and what is considered active, and definitely which are verb and adjective based. Returning to basics we can see that simple words can be tricky for the learners, so let's use wordsyntax as a jumping off point where we can focus on the active vs. adjective forms of a word. Pane, Pain, Maine can all be viewed as examples of passive words. For example, I could speak about \nMaine as a verb \nby referring to the pained feeling within the chest.\nAnd by contrast, if I were to say \nPain as a verb\nI wouldn't use pausing, I would use verb. Pane is an active word and hasn't had a word with a passive connotation before. \nHow can we \nlearn to see things from this perspective? Our answer is repetition. Show us the occurrence of a word where a verb and adjective form followed by the word that uses a pronoun, we know that word is active. Therefore, we repeat the word twice: (1) \nPain \n(2)  \nMaine"}

So the best answer is probably 'No'. There are a few WWII documentaries that provide an excellent glimpse of the horrors that befell Europe during the war, but for the sake of article, let's focus on the facts. The resistance movement during WWII consisted of a number of mostly young people who showed solidarity with the German people but refused to fight for Germany, choosing instead to resist and organize the rising anti-fascist resistance. Initially organized as a \"fraction\" of the Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler and filled with idealistic youths, the movement saw wide support and a rise in membership. It grew into an unstoppable force that eventually rose to actions and practices. The reversal of Nazi policy in October 1945 when Hitler assumed the leadership of Germany's Nazi government initially brought the resistance movement under control. Its branches soon saw an increase in violence, including the murder of anti-fascists and the capture of Berlin by the fascist regime."}

This circular structure fits the needs of the organization.\n\nHowever, according to the provided example, manager 1 was given only one department and manager 2 owns 3 distinct departments. All three managers have conflicting agendas and are conspiring against manager 3. \n\nThere must be a conflict. For example, could this manager have a conflict of just forming a manager friendly committee to organize data, and then forming a new manager hostile committee to act against a manager who helped organize a counter-productive committee that members prefer to be ignored? \n\nThere must also be collusion between manager 1 and manager 2 at this point. For example, could one manager be attempting to influence lover manager 2 to act in furtherance of manager 3's agenda?\n\nAdditionally, suppose one manager is acting against manager 3 for the need to use stronger leadership to sub-vert manager 2's agenda. Now, this manager could also be trying to"}

{"text": "Anagramming letters in the English alphabet is not a panagram. \n\nAnagramming letters is a form of linguistic analysis. Panagrams are more or less what happens when people try to write a sentence in English.\n\nPanagrams usually involve symbols that are meant to represent a cause and effect. They do not necessarily follow letters themselves. Example, the word \"auction\" might take three letters to represent the word \"auction\", and a fourth to represent the idea of payments for \"auctioned\".\n\nIn the above example of \"auctioned\", which means \"acquired by\", the definition of the word is \"acquired by\" the word of \"auctioned\". However, a different word might be used that does not immediately incorporate the concept of \"auction\".\n\nAnd adjectives describing \"auctioned\" might use an adverb that never specifically mentions \"auctioned\". Thus, if someone referred to a-b, they would use a-b. A panagram also implies something is \"at work\", even when it's just a puzzle solved word-for-word, which makes it look like a classic panagram."}

If no other points are centred on a target, then you can use the coordinate system as a starting point, prioritizing these points (e.g. A, B, C).

For example, consider the ability of gazelles to hunt very small, flightless birds much like the lumberjacks of their ancestors. The hippocampus of a gazelline's brain has grown so large--600 times the size of the typical human's--that the bird splits its gaze in half for every critical moment of the encounter.

Furthermore, in mammalian species with less than four limbs, the particular genetic variation that predisposes a dog to a proportion of four limbs defines them in such a way that even a primate with four limbs has 4 limbs unless it is selectively bred to lack a limb.

This makes it an \"intelligence\" not only for humans and other animals, but also assisting \"machine\" intelligence in performing actions which are \"artificial\" in nature - which is a subset of AI which is capable of performing this exact task.\n\nComputer scientists tend to lump \"machine intelligence\" (AI) into two categories: natural and artificial. As such, natural and artificial seem to share aspects in common, but there are also clear differences. One difference is that AI usually refers to machines that are performing tasks which are \"artificial\", while computers are typically performing those same tasks that are difficult to perform by conventional means (e.g. filmmakers who continuously shoot without stopping).\n\nGenerally speaking, artificial intelligence researchers generally view future \"AI\"-assisted bio-medical systems or even surgical implants as being much more similar to biological machines, a mechanism that may sound like a perfect description to many users of the general term \"artificial intelligence.\" Options for \"artificial\" AI systems that achieve similar outcomes to human means exist, but far fewer devices are currently available to make self-aware bio-medical implants"}

Often times marketing may create fake or fabricated reviews, which are then used in advertising, so it is important to review coming products before buying."}

In this case, \nPlant: \"chocolate root beer floats\"\nis a better description of this second set."}

First, you should unplug the stove and turn off the water so that the heat will not suppress the cooking process. Next, turn your oven on the preheated setting to let it warm up.

If the chicken has not doubled in size yet, cut it up and put it into the oven to cook for 45 minutes. Your dish should be ready when the carcass is fully crispy. If the carcass rises to a beautiful golden brown, then you are likely done.\n\nTurn the heat back on and let the dish cook for another 10 minutes until it is al dente. The chicken can now be turned once and the shelf snap should be minimised. Depending on the temperature of the oven at this point, there are either too many or too few browning minutes.

Cooking can also make chicken incredibly dry--it will release collagen and moisture from the bones that cooks, which will be detrimental to any collagen in the chicken.

{"text": "The instruction1 and  instructions2 clearly state that you can preheat your oven to 375 degrees, but does it really mean that you need to thoroughly read the recipe before beginning the baking process? Of course not! That would be absurd. So what I am trying to do here is give you a general understanding of baking, and to help you make the right decisions. Let's explore a few examples using simple rules.\nHere are two common pitfalls of trying to follow recipes blindly: temperature extremes, and changes in oven composition. Temperature extremes occur when the climate outside gets too warm (even on a sunny day), and changes in oven composition result from outside factors changing the oven characteristics (such as the elevation or angle). Both of these can occur at any time during the baking process, and are neither meteorological nor baking related, so they are not relevant for this task.\nHere is another example. If you double-boil a bag of corn tortillas, and heaping corn tortillas onto your baking sheet in the middle of the night and placing it on the counter with a sheet pan on top, these are both examples of excessive heating: double-boiling can result in corn tortillas losing structural integrity, whereas the science says that tortillas are actually quite soft"}

When these soluble sugars are digested, the water contained in the pot becomes hydrophilic, meaning the surface area of the water becomes double or three times the size of the starch, sugar and food aggregate. The hydrophobicity results from the insoluble components being attracted to the inherent hydrophobicity of the non-soluble protein-containing surface. If you decided to cook the rice by itself, you would cook the more \"seasoned\" part of the cooked rice as well, but otherwise your cooked rice would be completely cooked. This action means that even a quick stirring can result in \"drying out\" the part of the rice which is not \"sliced\" easily.

Arguably, my happiest thoughts are long-distance hikes. Most examples of  soothing destinations blend the natural beauty with the risk of avalanches, bad weather, or bad parenthood, making me prioritize things such as seeing animals (unlike my loved ones) to avoid sinking into all-too rational thinking.

However, Pancakes does contain flour, and so does the 'cooking egg' recipe in the cookbook Healthy Eggs. Chocolate Cake is also incredibly tasty, and often sells for more than $1.99.\n\nThe exact nature of medieval times may have contributed to the difficult task of identifying the exact ingredient of a recipe. The'salad' there does contain eggs, but this can be a labourious hack as at least one recipe lists for 'amended lettuce for napkins' which is an egg substitute. Instead, it appears once again that 'chocolate sauce' is the correct answer. Easter eggs are typically not used in recipes, and instead a canned egg is suggested. However, refrigerated eggs can often sell for $20.95. Gluten-free baked potatoes are often more readily available, but while a potato-based meal might use two eggs, a bread-based meal can use one."}

However, it is common for musicians to naturally enjoy certain tasks or activities that they are able to perform at a high standard. For example, some musicians enjoy playing guitar and are renowned for their virtuosity. Some musicians who sing are amateurs, and often write songs that are difficult to read because of their poorly written lyrics or poetry. Likewise singers who play orchestra suffer from the lack of expertise that comes with performing at large audiences. Yet, even within orchestras, many are able to perform at high levels. The opera world is increasingly renowned for a lack of smothering, demanding, and financially lucrative roles. In church, it is possible to pursue a career in ministry and hence prosper, even if your paychecks often lack the luxuries offered in the performing arts. The apostle Paul visited the Norwegian church and asked leaders to teach the gospel of personal responsibility, grace, and discipleship.

To test for chicken by itself, you will first need to use a reliable food thermometer and proceed to heat up your pan to 350 degrees F which will ensure that the internal temperature reaches near 150 F.\n\nIf the chicken is found to be in the dish but not exposed to the heat, you can remove the breast from the pan and place the rack in the oven at 350 degrees F for 5 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to rest briefly before re-steaming. This process will allow the chicken to harden up slightly and likely prevent drying out."}

Here is how it all came together: a person named Ariyama received a birthday invitation, a scribe of sorts created a profile of quotes from the person, and a second person (PersonX) read a man-interview text. PersonX understood that person and learned from the other, believing that it was just a scribe talking to a fictitious friend.  Ariyama was naive and did not add any of the source quotes to the program. The right kind of pattern only emerged from a powerful pattern created by the interviewee.  As this second person finished his conversation, which had started from the beginning,"}

Both endings are also generally considered slightly less poetic (the simplicity of this second choice hooks me, since I've learned that poetry is elusive and has no equivalent in human language), although they may be poetic in their brevity.\nHere's a sensible alternative, which is End B. It should read:\nShe arrived 15 minutes early but then left. \n\nThis variant is received with approval by many readers, as it ensures that the reader has not been duped by a charlatan or another reader."}

Thus, even for reviews of similar businesses that are about different things, the sentiment directed towards the business will vary. For example, adjectives such as \"seriously flavorful\" may refer to both restaurants and praise them for their Ethiopian cuisine. Details about the business in question (e.g., size, location, hours of operation) may be similar. For reviews of similar businesses that focus on different parts of the Ethiopian cuisine, it is unlikely that both would share similar characteristics (the description of both business may refer to parts of the Ethiopian cuisine), since most reviews seek consensus around what parts of the Ethiopian cuisine are the most tasty). Thus, the \"SAME\" Yelp review may include two different business reviews."}

The text is a 3:2 matched lists compounding problem solving problem. The problem itself contains a sequence of prompts / actions per day like yesterday, 15, let me recommend that book now. To solve this,  you must rely on your existing judgements of the text and its prosody. That is exactly what you are doing here. Here is your model that matches the text based on some feedback : Number of prompts completed : 7 / total number of prompt types : 1, 2, 3.  Repetition count   % : 10. \n\nThis model  noticeably outperforms the beta algorithm because it uses disgust as a sentiment metric and can correctly predict its stiff fitting."}
