This can be done by dividing the length of A by the length of B, or by counting the number of occurrences of the respective characters within each string. If either text is longer than the other, then its length will be counted twice. Once the number of occurrences of a particular character in either text is determined, then that character can be replaced with another character in the opposite text to shorten the resulting string."}

Specifications are well-defined sequences of instructions that describe the algorithm to be run, along with the conditions under which the algorithm will compute the value listed in the specification. Algorithms are frequently used in practice, both to compute complex values and to run simple operations.\n\nAdditionally, algorithms are used in a variety of disciplines, including data processing, automated reasoning, and computer science, to name a few. So, while you may not have specifically been focusing on algorithms when you were learning computer science, you actually learned about algorithms overall."}

The second piece of evidence is the very slow speed of the moon's orbit around the Earth. If the moon was orbiting Earth at the speed of an artillery shot, it would take about fifty years to circle the Earth. If the speed of the moon's spin is calculated, it results in an orbit that is even slower than Earth's orbit around the Sun. \n\nThe third and final piece of evidence is the recent discovery that the moon doesn't have a substantially thicker atmosphere than Earth. If the moon had a substantially thicker atmosphere, then the moon would likely have already returned to Earth."}

Therefore, to ensure that exp is valid, you can use a wrapper function:\n\ndef validate(x):\nif not x:\nraise ValueError(x, KeyError)\n\nThe validate function takes two parameters: a start integer, which specifies the first value in the list that should be valid, and an optional limit, which restricts the values that can be returned. If the start and limit are both specified, then valid will be True for each element in the list. Otherwise, valid will be False for each element in the range if either is not specified."}

Access to the painting was initially denied to Christians who were ruled as non-Muslims during the Renaissance period.  Pope Clement V declared the painting free of charge to all Church patrons on April 4th, 1503.\n\nThe Mona Lisa has had several owners over the years.  Assistance was provided by an anonymous donor who bought it from the Medici's daughter, Lisa Gherardini in 1612.  In 1931, it was purchased by an Italian businessman, Benito Mussolini, and resided at his place of business in Milan until his death in 1943.

{"text": "There are several pieces of feedback that include a negative sentiment. Since this is a quantitative task, it is easiest to compare the reviews against each other using a negative binomial distribution. \n\nThe first column in the table is the review score, which ranges from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). The second column is the sentiment score, which is a scale from 0 (negative) to 10 (positive). \n\nThe median of the spectrum is 0, meaning that half the scores in the range 0-10 have a negative sentiment. Since the range of review scores is 20-30, which includes 19 reviews, this means that half the reviews have a positive sentiment. \n\nThe top half of the spectrum consists of the reviews with the highest positive sentiment. These reviews are weighted by the number of reviews they contain, so a 1-weighted review will contain 1% of the votes for a positive sentiment, and a 0-weighted review will include 0% of the votes for positive sentiment. \nDragon Lady says: \nI went to this restaurant for lunch today and absolutely hated it.

For example, the sentence \n\nJohn went to the store to buy himself and apple and crackers.\n\nrequires a hyphen to be preserved in order for the sentence to be grammatical. Allocaion, the determiner, is dropped in this case. If a sentence contains an imperative, the infinitive is also dropped.\n\nOne distinctive feature of syntactic grammar is that determiners always precede the verb. This is illustrated in the simple example\n\nJohn went tothe store to buy himself andapple and crackers.\nThere is only one determiner in this example, which is determiner-ending. In many languages, including English, the determiner usually comes before the verb.\n\nAnother characteristic of syntactic grammar is adjective-ending sentences. This means that the adjective of a named entity is placed after the item it identifies. For example, the"}

{"text": "This task is difficult because many restaurants have both good and bad reviews. It is important to select the proper category to analyze the review. Food is typically the most important category, since it is personal to you. However, because this is a online task, not all restaurants have an explicit menu page, so you may need to search for their name to find their dishes. \n\nIn this case, you can think of other things to consider when choosing a restaurant: is the food objectively great or is it just the chef's opinion? If the latter, this may not be the best restaurant for you. Another issue is that reviews can be heavily influenced by the location - if the restaurant is busy and noisy, the reviews may be less positive. In this case, it is always better to go nearby restaurants or nearby stores to get a more accurate assessment.\n\nTo reduce the noise and ensure an unbiased assessment, it is best to combine the above two criteria - is the food great or is the service bad. This combination of factors should give you the best overview of the restaurant and its review."}

Before starting PCR, you must confirm that the distance between the nucleotides in S1 and S2 is at least six.\n\nPCR can be performed using any methods that are available for separating water soluble molecules, such as oligonucleotides, and these can be combined with survive templates, such as viral sequences.\n\nThe simplest way to create a PCR reaction mixture is to contain a starting DNA sequence of either two template strands or one template and one reaction mixture.\n\nFollowing the protocol above, when using two template strands, the resulting mixture will contain equal amounts of the template DNA and the Reaction Mix, which will contain the appropriate number of cycles for the PCR reaction.\n\nTo generate S2, first separate the two strands of DNA by six nucleotides. Then, in a separate container, contain a neutralizing agent (eg RNase treated with water).\n\nAfter separating the two strands, put the combined DNA samples into a battery, and activate the PCR machine.

If it's 0, then the token \"I\" is slightly closer to the starting token \"saw\" than the ending token \"the\".\n    - Repeat for each token in the range of tokens between \"I\" and the corresponding span \"saw\".\n\n- Look for repeated words or token sequences. For example, a list of three words \"the\", \"y\", \"e\" may be much shorter than a list of two words \"the\", \"z\", \"e\".\n\n- Check if the paths between the two NEs are strictly increasing. For example, the first path from \"I\" to \"saw\" must be \"I | saw\", and the second from \"I\" to the \"movie\" must be \"MGM | John\". If they are not increasing, then"}
