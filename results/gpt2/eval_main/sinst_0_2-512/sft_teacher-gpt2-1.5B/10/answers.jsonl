As a person who has suffered from Angina, I can relate to the feeling of confusion and insecurity that can set into a person's life when a diagnosis of PMS is made. I think that describing this feeling in the abstract is very well done.\nUnstable: Yes, this is another very close term to home for many people. I feel like this is a very challenging term to use because it can apply to so many different things. For example, when a person is experiencing unexpected weight loss, it can feel very unstable to the outside world. They may feel misunderstood and even need to hide their new weight, which can in turn create more stress and worry for themselves. On the other hand, when a person is reporting positive marks on a schizophrenia check-in, it can seem very unstable to the observer. How do you determine which term to use? It really depends on the person and their reaction to the given term.\nCoronary Disease: This is a very complex term, which I felt needed to be included in the abstract to give context to the above mentioned feeling.

This can lead to better understanding of our shared interests, better networking skills, and even better decisions in our daily lives. As more and more people use social media, it will continue to improve and even spread to more and more people. In the end, I think social media can still improve our society as a whole."}

If the person making the confession has never been convicted of a crime, it is supporting, if they have been convicted of a crime and are appealing their conviction, it is undermined.\n\nNow that we have established that the person making the claim has confessed to a crime, let's take a look at the perspective provided by this person. This perspective can help us decide whether or not to believe this person's claims. If this person is speaking from experience, they are sharing their experience with you to help you make an informed decision. If the person providing the perspective has never been convicted of any crime, it is supporting. If the person providing perspective has been convicted of a crime but is appealing their conviction, it could be broken down into two parts: support and uncertainty. If the person appealing their conviction has experience with the criminal justice system, this could help bolster their conviction, or it could cast doubt on their credibility.\n\nIn conclusion, while this task provides a perspective on how to respond to a claim, it is not an instruction on how to conduct yourself in court."}

Consequently, most people in the British colonies consider Lord Nelson to be a role model, and his reputation among the people of the British colonies is such that most people view him as a hero. In addition, most of the colonists sympathize with the British cause because, after all, they are also victims of Spanish rule. Thus, most of the colonists consider Lord Nelson a candidate A and Edwin Starr a candidate B. While Edward is a sinner, he is not a villain, and Darcy is a saint.
