The cost of maintaining the embargo runs counter to the will of the people on the island, since the money spent on such a development is largely lost to the state.

{"text": "The perspective that children should not be allowed to inherited vast wealth as this damages their development is also called moral hazard. The environmental impact of allowing children to have unlimited wealth contradicts the goals of our society, as shown by the increasing gap between rich and poor across countries. Also, children who do not receive universal education are unlikely to be able to fully develop their skills as adults. According to a recent study, 70 percent of the wealth of the 1% of the world's population comes from capital gains, while the remaining 20% comes from income from capital gains. The social benefits of allowing children to have more wealth are limited due to the high cost of educating them. While there are some benefits to allowing children to have more money, they lose out socially and suffer from reduced growth, making it less likely that they will be able to sustain their current lifestyle."}

Wind power is a critical power source that will allow for future generations to enjoy electricity generated from wind.  It is a large source of renewable energy that will most likely continue to generate electricity for electric grids.  The future of wind power depends in part on the deployment of solar photovoltaics, which is growing rapidly. In addition, wind power represents a proven technology that can significantly lower emissions and is a proven way to create new jobs in the energy sector.\n\nHowever, as technology moves forward, new challenges are arising that make continued investment in wind power more challenging.  The data suggests that, counterintuitively, as solar captures the lion's share of the installed power generation in the near future, wind power is losing ground.  Consequently, we should abandon the project of building massive new wind power stations and concentrate instead on local deployment of wind farms and on the design and deployment of storage batteries that can sustainably capture the demand for electricity generated from wind power while also maintaining the environment."}

If everyone wants to attend a good school, then everyone can attend a good school, regardless of his or her ability to pay for it. This is the perfect example of laissez-faire, with no market failures or external pressures that force students to attend poorly performing schools.\n\nThe alternative view, which also does not support the primacy of the school system over the individual preferences of individuals, is that school vouchers encourage more competition among private schools. In this case, competition harms individual students by limiting the supply of good school mates, and\n\ncreates a poor market."}

{"text": "My friends and I came over for a fondule party last week and he asked if there was wine available because he was allergic.  I said there was and we did not want him to eat it.  He then asked if there was any wine in the fondue and I said yes.  Then he asked if there was a way to get the wine so he could stop eating it.  I said yes and he stopped eating the fondue.  Then he asked again if there was wine in what we ate and I said yes.\n\nNow, this is a tricky question because it depends on your understanding of what happened.  If you simply ate the first instance of the story and then asked the question again, the story would not make sense because you would have to have reported the event to someone who knows the story.  Furthermore, the person asking the question would not know either the specific fondue recipe or the person[s] who made the fondue.  Therefore, your prompt should be, \"then why did you say there was wine in the  cheese?\""}

As a result, violent video games have been demonized as some kind of \"harmful\" or even \"unpleasant\".
