New nuclear power plants would also take considerable time to build and would likely increase safety concerns.\n\nTherefore, we should not build new nuclear power plants, as it risks overheating the already strained nuclear power grid and might damage public health."}

Let's start by defining 'heterosexual'. As an example, within the US, one is considered male or female based on their assigned birth date. While there is no legal definition for 'other gender', it has been suggested that people who feel they are not'mixed', just male or female. It follows that same sex relationships between people of the same gender should have the same legal protection. If you look at the EU law, it specifically mentions that same sex relationships between consenting adults should be treated the same as opposite sex relationships. So essentially, same sex relationships between adults should be treated the way adults between adults are. The whole point of EU law, is to protect children and ensure they have the same legal protection as adults. However, there are many things that can go wrong between adults; for example children may not know or understand the basic concepts of consent, and abuse can occur. Furthermore, same sex relationships can cause great harm between partners, such as damage to mental health. So, just because same sex relationships are mentioned in EU law does not mean it necessarily means they should always be accepted. There"}

The young woman, now in her 60s, lived with her children, aged from two to five months, before being brutally murdered in the basement of the house (with a kitchen knife). The identity of the suspect was not released until years later, when DNA testing revealed that the DNA of the young victim was her brother, Roy Williams.\n\nAfter the police discovered the crime, they proceeded to investigate Marjorie's disappearance. The media had reported that her home had been broken into at least twice in the previous month, but the FBI quickly followed up on the leads received from the earlier burglaries. Detectives Robert Gohmert and Bill Williams conducted a \"time capsule review\" of files relating to Marjorie. They learned that she had once been employed by the Civil Rights Movement"}

This is especially true when it comes to the drone strike program. The US military has been engaged in secret drone strikes for years, and as a result, hundreds of civilians have been killed or maimed as a result. While the military claims that the targeted individuals pose an existential threat to the United States, the reality is that most likely these individuals would pose no threat to the United States. The very nature of the targeted individuals, their locations, and their activities make them vulnerable to being targeted by a future government. In addition, as the global tensions surrounding the nuclear arms race mount, international tensions surrounding the use of drones have increased. Despite these increased tensions, the military and intelligence community continue to use secrecy and ideological agendas in their drone program, with the manifest result of innocent civilians being killed or maimed. While the US military sometimes claims that secrecy has driven down the cost of employing a strike team, in reality the most expensive strike team is not an option for many individuals. Additionally, the development of opaque contracts and rules for employing a drone strike team has also resulted in an environment where a bad actor can make extremely large investments in their"}

His family had moved to Hawaii during World War II and his aunt and uncle worked at NASA as flight engineers, so Jason was exposed to a lot of different kinds of engineering during his formative years. The kind of engineering that could change his life and career path was flying. Suddenly, at the age of 13, Jason found himself in an unusual position where he was flying experimental aircraft that had been built secretly by NASA. Out of sheer curiosity, Jason dove into the deep end of NASA's research on UFOs and eventually found his calling as a high-level project engineer. Over the course of his career, Jason learned all of the ins and outs of flying high-tech aircraft of all types, including how to maintain the engines while turning the engines off. During his time at NASA, Jason also dove into deep into classified research on UFOs, certain technologies to reverse engineer and recover UFOs, and how to get close to an alien species. He even became an expert on electromagnetic signals and their properties. After returning to the States, Jason returned to Hawaii to begin his new life as an aerospace engineer.

The paragraph does not explain why Peter would want to keep the shield, nor why he would need to borrow Captain America's shield in the first place. Furthermore, the shield is not particularly valuable - if it was, anyone with a modicum of Spidey's super-powers could take it away from him pretty easily.\n\nThe most likely explanation, which is what Peter is trying to sell, is that he took the shield from someone, which is why he says in the paragraph that he took the shield \"from someone\". But that explanation doesn't make much sense given that Spider-Man is not a homicidal maniac, and there is no evidence to suggest that any of these people would want to kill Spider-Man for his shield.

The Basic Income Tax provide a guaranteed basic income for all citizens regardless of work experience or pre-existing liabilities, subject to certain basic conditions.  As a basic income is a payment for individuals to work, it imposes a high social cost.  Reduced work hours, reduced hours of schooling, and greater independence have all been shown to reduce work hours and improve work productivity.  Yet despite the positive effects of BI on work productivity, some argue that too little BI has resulted in significant labor shortages. Instead, the U.S. federal government should increase the BI payment so as to provide funding to states and localities with a sufficient amount of BI workers to ensure sufficient work hours, schooling and independence for the population.\n\nThe BI tax was originally proposed by a Scottish journalist and former First Minister of Scotland, Gordon Brown, in his book Brown Box.  Mr. Brown suggested this tax based on the collective income of all tax payers in Scotland.  He specifically mentioned the potential anti-poverty effect the BI would have on working people in Scotland.  In time, similar arguments by other Scottish politicians were used by U.K. former Prime Minister David Cameron"}

{"text": "The school voucher program helps improve education in general by allowing children in low-income families to attend a school that is also run by a non-profit organization, instead of the traditional public school system. This improves education by providing a place where children can receive a free ride to a good school, where parents can choose their children without having to send their children to a failing school, and where the children of good families can attend the school they like.\n\nHowever, there are several problems with the school voucher program. For one, children who attend the vouchers end up in a worse situation than children who do not because they end up in a worse school district for a variety of reasons, including poorer academic performance and behavioral issues. More importantly, children who do not attend the vouchers end up poorer as their performance in school suffers because they do not have the resources to attend the schools that their parents want.\n\nVouchers may also incentivize the use of ineffective or limited resources, such as resource block grant programs, which have been shown to reduce the quality of instruction in low-income children. Additionally, providing financial incentives, such as tax breaks or rebates, for school attendance may not be sufficient because children might not attend the schools where their parents want them."}

So \"yes, and\" implies yes, then; but since \"yes\" is a word that typically has negative connotations, we should instead use \"and\".\n\nThese directions make more sense now. \"Yes, and\" is an interjection that implies yes, but it can also expand on the idea by asking \"and then\". So \"yes, and then\" implies yes, then we can expand on the idea of \"after\" that this line of thought took place.\n\nThe other two lines in the prompt use \"and\" and \"and\". So the final answer to the question is \"yes, and then\".\n\nAlso note that even though both statements are true, the implication of \"yes\" in response 2 is stronger because it implies, for example, that you can put the idea into words, and then use it to get things"}

{"text": "Ron Kovic is born on the Fourth of July, 1946 and is an American anti-warrant activist, writer, and once considered himself a strong contender for the Vietnam War's highest civilian award, the Medal of Honor.  Thus, he is susceptible to the influence of his own prejudices, both positive and negative. Therefore, he can easily become entangled in an argument based on his prior association with the United States Marine Corps, which he himself admits to.  Because of this, it is logical to assume that his Vietnam War experience will have an indirect retraction effect on his later political statements. For example, it is conceivable that a Marine who served in Vietnam would later advocate for more U.S. military intervention in countries where the U.S. government has a vested interest in maintaining the rule of law. It is also conceivable that hatred for the United States Marine Corps would spark another round of political activism should Kovic become a political actor."}

Cast iron ingrapiers have many advantages over unheated ingratis. The first being that they don't require refrigeration - there's no heat sink in the ingress port. Second, they don't lose heat due to corrosion, which is important for slow-cooking food. The downside is that most unheated ingratus has a tendency to steam release its contents, which can crowd the port. However, unheated ingrata has a very high internal pressure, compared to the tens of bar of pressure of an unheated ingress port, thus insulating the food from the outside world."}
