In this setting, arms may not be comparable, and there may be several (incomparable) optimal arms. We propose an algorithm, UnchainedBandits, that efficiently finds the set of optimal arms of any poset even when pairs of comparable arms cannot be distinguished from pairs of incomparable arms, with a set of minimal assumptions. This algorithm relies on the concept of decoys, which stems from social psychology. For the easier case where the incomparability information may be accessible, we propose a second algorithm, SlicingBandits, which takes advantage of this information and achieves a very significant gain of performance compared to UnchainedBandits. We provide theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluation for both algorithms.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We are given a part of the article.

This device requires 12 to 15 W to pump 6 to 8 l/min with minimal hemolysis. The motor drive has functioned for periods up to 93 days in vivo with no measurable wear. The compliance chamber volume varies by 100 cc during VAD function but does so while maintaining pressure variations below 15 mmHg. Compliance chamber volume loss of 2 to 5 cc/day is explained by gas transport through SPU. The subcutaneous sampling port provides ready access to the sealed system.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The roller screw electric VAD can be made to be as light as the drum cam model. The only reason it requires 12 to 15 W is that it requires a pump that is less than the one used in the drum cam model.

Control of landing procedures: a combination of fixed and variable procedures is used to direct flight paths and allow for adequate time to ensure minimal loss of flight time. The typical approach involves an initial approach with a minimum of three to four turns and minimum of two approaches during which case the control of the direction of travel is solely determined by the angle of attack of the aircraft on the runway. <n><n>2. Control of airspace: all traffic is either routed through or within a designated airspace. All traffic must originate within the country or it must pass through an airport within that airspace. An example would be the United Airlines wayfinding system.<n><n>3. Noise cancellation: because of noise and traffic, aircraft and airport operations often generate a noise signal and divert flight paths. This control is achieved by employing a combination of deterrent techniques, including, but not limited to, employing aircraft based in the direction of travel to engage in landings and takeoffs, or by other means, such as by shutting down or depleting engine power to allow for more efficient use of runway time.

Though fairly pricey, the performance has been solid.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>While there has been substantial progress in factoid question-answering (QA), answering complex questions remains challenging, typically requiring both a large body of knowledge and inference techniques. Open Information Extraction (Open IE) provides a way to generate semi-structured knowledge for QA, but to date such knowledge has only been used to answer simple questions with retrievalbased methods. We overcome this limitation by presenting a method for reasoning with Open IE knowledge, allowing more complex questions to be handled. Using a recently proposed support graph optimization framework for QA, we develop a new inference model for Open IE, in particular one that can work effectively with multiple short facts, noise, and the relational structure of tuples. Our model significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art structured solver on complex questions of varying difficulty, while also removing the reliance on manually curated knowledge.<n><n>### Response:<n>		As part of our project, we are given a section of text. Your task is to create a headline for this text.

We apply our method to learning maximum entropy policies, resulting into a new algorithm, called soft Q-learning, that expresses the optimal policy via a Boltzmann distribution. We use the recently proposed amortized Stein variational gradient descent to learn a stochastic sampling network that approximates samples from this distribution. The benefits of the proposed algorithm include improved exploration and compositionality that allows transferring skills between tasks, which we confirm in simulated experiments with swimming and walking robots. We also draw a connection to actorcritic methods, which can be viewed performing approximate inference on the corresponding energy-based model.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We propose a new approach to learning an expressive energy-based policy for continuous states and actions.
