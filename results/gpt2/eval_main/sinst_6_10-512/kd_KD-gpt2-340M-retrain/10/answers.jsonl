Control of landing procedures: a combination of fixed and variable procedures is used to direct flight paths and allow for adequate time to ensure minimal loss of flight time. The typical approach involves an initial approach with a minimum of three to four turns and minimum of two approaches during which case the control of the direction of travel is solely determined by the angle of attack of the aircraft on the runway. \n\n2. Control of airspace: all traffic is either routed through or within a designated airspace. All traffic must originate within the country or it must pass through an airport within that airspace. An example would be the United Airlines wayfinding system.\n\n3. Noise cancellation: because of noise and traffic, aircraft and airport operations often generate a noise signal and divert flight paths. This control is achieved by employing a combination of deterrent techniques, including, but not limited to, employing aircraft based in the direction of travel to engage in landings and takeoffs, or by other means, such as by shutting down or depleting engine power to allow for more efficient use of runway time."}
