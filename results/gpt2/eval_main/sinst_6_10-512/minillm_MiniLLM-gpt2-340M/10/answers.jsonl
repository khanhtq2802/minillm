{"text": "A bandwidth no packet switching (BNPS) is a problem in distributed data processing where packets are sent to a remote server and then re-assembled in the local server. There are various techniques for deriving efficient answers to this problem. One approach is to use a distributed hash table (DHT) to identify the correct answer. If the answer is in the form of a hash table, then only the most recent entry in the table is used. If the answer is a string, then all of the lines in the string are used as input. If the answer is an address, then the list of addresses is used as the answer.\n\nBuckminster Fuller created the concept of BNPS in 1956.  In this article, he explains how BNPS is an implementation detail of a distributed hash table.  He also explains how BNPS can be used to solve real-world problems such as bandwidth allocation and caching."}

{"text": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting brain cells throughout the body. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that patients with Parkinson's disease do not have a general visuospatial deficit, as is previously reported in other studies. In order to determine if the clinical patient is indeed impaired in spatial ability, we performed a review of the literature and measured the performance of patients with Parkinson disease. We found that both accuracy and reaction time were consistently high in the spatial components of these tasks. The results of this study are consistent with the idea of a general visuospacial deficit in Parkinson's disease, and suggest that a better understanding of the nature of the problem and the potential mechanisms underlying it may help to improve the treatment of this disease."}
