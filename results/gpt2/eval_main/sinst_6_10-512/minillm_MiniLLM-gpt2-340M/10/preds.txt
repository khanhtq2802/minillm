In this setting, arms may not be comparable, and there may be several (incomparable) optimal arms. We propose an algorithm, UnchainedBandits, that efficiently finds the set of optimal arms of any poset even when pairs of comparable arms cannot be distinguished from pairs of incomparable arms, with a set of minimal assumptions. This algorithm relies on the concept of decoys, which stems from social psychology. For the easier case where the incomparability information may be accessible, we propose a second algorithm, SlicingBandits, which takes advantage of this information and achieves a very significant gain of performance compared to UnchainedBandits. We provide theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluation for both algorithms.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We propose an algorithm, UnchainingBandits, that efficiently identifies the set of optimal arms for any poset even when both arms are comparable.<n><n>We also propose a second algorithm, SkippingBandits, which takes advantages of the information available to the algorithm and achieves a significant gain in performance.<n><n>We provide theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluations for both algorithms.

There are various techniques for deriving efficient answers to this problem. One approach is to use a distributed hash table (DHT) to identify the correct answer. If the answer is in the form of a hash table, then only the most recent entry in the table is used. If the answer is a string, then all of the lines in the string are used as input. If the answer is an address, then the list of addresses is used as the answer.<n><n>Buckminster Fuller created the concept of BNPS in 1956.  In this article, he explains how BNPS is an implementation detail of a distributed hash table.  He also explains how BNPS can be used to solve real-world problems such as bandwidth allocation and caching.

The EpiReader is an end-to-end neural model comprising two components: the first component proposes a small set of candidate answers after comparing a question to its supporting text, and the second component formulates hypotheses using the proposed candidates and the question, then reranks the hypotheses based on their estimated concordance with the supporting text.

The present experiment was designed to test two fundamental aspects of spatial ability, namely right-left discrimination and the manipulation of those concepts in different spatial perspectives. Measures of accuracy and reaction time were taken. The performance of patients with Parkinson's disease did not differ from that of normal subjects in the spatial components of the task. Neither a review of the literature, nor the results of the present study, give support to the idea of a generalized visuospatial deficit in Parkinson's disease.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting brain cells throughout the body. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that patients with Parkinson's disease do not have a general visuospatial deficit, as is previously reported in other studies. In order to determine if the clinical patient is indeed impaired in spatial ability, we performed a review of the literature and measured the performance of patients with Parkinson disease. We found that both accuracy and reaction time were consistently high in the spatial components of these tasks. The results of this study are consistent with the idea of a general visuospacial deficit in Parkinson's disease, and suggest that a better understanding of the nature of the problem and the potential mechanisms underlying it may help to improve the treatment of this disease.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>While there has been substantial progress in factoid question-answering (QA), answering complex questions remains challenging, typically requiring both a large body of knowledge and inference techniques. Open Information Extraction (Open IE) provides a way to generate semi-structured knowledge for QA, but to date such knowledge has only been used to answer simple questions with retrievalbased methods. We overcome this limitation by presenting a method for reasoning with Open IE knowledge, allowing more complex questions to be handled. Using a recently proposed support graph optimization framework for QA, we develop a new inference model for Open IE, in particular one that can work effectively with multiple short facts, noise, and the relational structure of tuples. Our model significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art structured solver on complex questions of varying difficulty, while also removing the reliance on manually curated knowledge.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Our new model performs better than a state-of-art structured solver when solving complex questions of varying difficulty.

We use the recently proposed amortized Stein variational gradient descent to learn a stochastic sampling network that approximates samples from this distribution. The benefits of the proposed algorithm include improved exploration and compositionality that allows transferring skills between tasks, which we confirm in simulated experiments with swimming and walking robots. We also draw a connection to actorcritic methods, which can be viewed performing approximate inference on the corresponding energy-based model.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Learning a stochastic sampling distribution over an ensemble of agents leads to a new algorithm called soft Q-learning that expresses the optimal policy using a Boltzmann distribution, which we confirm in simulations with swimming and walking robots

I've charged my iPad and iPhone, and they both charge in under 5 minutes. The only reason I'm not giving this a 5-star rating is because it took longer than I'd like to charge my iPad. But I really like the idea of charging multiple devices at the same time.<n><n>Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase. I'm definitely going to be ordering more of these chargers.
