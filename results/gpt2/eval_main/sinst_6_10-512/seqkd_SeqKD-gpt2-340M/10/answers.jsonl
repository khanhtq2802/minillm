{"text": "The epidemiology of severe burns (also known as cigarette smoking) is analysed. From 1 January 1982 to 31 August 1983, 75 patients, 27 females, 48 males were admitted to The Burns Unit in Denmark. The majority of burns (domestic and fire) were related to fire, and females were more likely to suffer from burns sustained during domestic fires. The most vulnerable areas include the arms and the legs and small children still have a higher incidence of thermal injury, owing to the risk of fires being the predominant cause."}
{"text": "The Senate Racing funds bill to end the government shut down was voted down by the US Senate on Thursday night.  The vote followed a 36-0 vote by the US House of Representatives to kill the bill in the House and then shortly thereafter the President issued a veto threat.  It is now clear to many that Senator Susan Collins, the Republican leader who pushed for the bill's passage, had Republican senators vote no on the bill.  She became the target of a brutal and public spanking at the hands of three Republican senators - including one who voted against the bill and three who changed their votes in the face of key Democratic votes.\nThe Senate Republican leader tells Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell he can no longer afford to lose the vote.  After the nudge from Collins' office, McConnell caved to the demands of the president who wants to pass the funding bill.\nMcConnell tells McConnell his options are difficult but he told him to use the legislative maneuver known as a cloture vote, which even some top Obama political players oppose as a way to force Democrats to vote against the bill.  That was the key to Collins winning a crucial Senate vote that nearly all Senate Democrats and parts of her own caucus voted against."}

Detailed examination in the early stages of synoviosis results in industry-standard joint infections,[91] but often even those that are difficult to detect are significant sequelae.[92] For some individuals, sclerosing cell disease may develop as a result of tissue colonization, such as retroviral mutations, which unexposed synovials might carry.[93] Over the past several classes of therapies, including immunotherapy,[94] and even anti-inflammatory drugs,[95] there has been little progress in treating malignant"}

{"text": "1) Increasing inequality harms by increasing the gap between the haves and have-nots \n2) Increasing inequality harms \n\nThe relevant questions in this passage come from a questionaire, which lists questions that have certain interruptions in them and that should be answered by the proper question. \n\nBelow is the correct form of this response without any disfluency:\nI would argue that increasing inequality harms inequality.  To hold that investing in education is a positive and universal sentiment for which  everyone should aspire, we strongly need to invest in higher education.  To argue that investing in wealth inequality is a just distribution of wealth is a topic for which everyone should work hard and appear to have at least a modest level of social mobility.  Therefore, we should not simply criticize those who get rich by means other than wealth creation, but also call out the corrupt individuals who accumulate wealth through immoral means.  While I believe we should pursue the goal of equitability of society, widening the gap between the havers and have-nots is clearly not feasible from a distributive perspective.  It is clear from the passage that this is my preferred response, part of the reason I used only \"yes\" and \"no\" to collect questions."}

This is what is meant by 'be irrational'; that is;'must support'.  As such, 'be irrational' helps to compartmentalize the effects in the included example and not raise complications in causality.  \n'irve' is irrelevant in this case.  'be irrational' serves as an inventory of the impairments caused by the 'irve', i.e. it is necessary for mining the implications' in an intellectually simplistic manner.

Also, buying company stock (which many ABO customers do) can take up to 18 months, and their funds can get frozen if a lot of transactions stay under 18 months. Another problem is some companies try to avoid accounting for when actual investments occur, which can lead to a loss.\n\n1. The company's financial statements show that the money actually invested was 14.14% of ABO's total assets, so the total amount spent is 14.14% of $1,000,000,000, which is close to 0.04x the annual revenue of 14,450,050,000.\n2. To take advantage of the 10% offered on the leveraged loan (for a total of $800,000), the company has to make 40% of the loan payments, which is close to 30% of the current market price.\n3. To calculate the return on the invested amount, multiply the annual net investment return on $800,000 by 3.\n4. The loss on 0.04x the yearly revenue of 14,450market equates to $0.19, which is close to 1/0.14 x $"}
