In this setting, arms may not be comparable, and there may be several (incomparable) optimal arms. We propose an algorithm, UnchainedBandits, that efficiently finds the set of optimal arms of any poset even when pairs of comparable arms cannot be distinguished from pairs of incomparable arms, with a set of minimal assumptions. This algorithm relies on the concept of decoys, which stems from social psychology. For the easier case where the incomparability information may be accessible, we propose a second algorithm, SlicingBandits, which takes advantage of this information and achieves a very significant gain of performance compared to UnchainedBandits. We provide theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluation for both algorithms.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Trials of the Arm

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you have to generate the title of the recipe given its required ingredients and directions.<n><n>### Input:<n>ingredients:  '1 c. skim milk', '1 Tbsp. cornstarch', '1/2 tsp. dry mustard', '1/8 tsp. pepper', '3/4 c. shredded American cheese', '1 (10 oz.) pkg. frozen mixed vegetables, cooked and drained', '4 medium baking potatoes (6 to 8 oz. each), baked',<sep> directions: 'In a small saucepan stir together milk, cornstarch, mustard and pepper.', 'Cook and stir until thickened and bubbly.', 'Add cheese, stirring until melted.', 'Stir in mixed vegetables and heat through.', 'Serve warm over baked potatoes.', 'Serves 4.'<n><n>### Response:<n>		Shim milk, cornstarch and mustard are required to make this recipe.  You will need the skim milk, fresh crushed cheese, potatoes, and the frozen vegetables.  (You will need the frozen vegetables to help ensure that the dough doesn't stick to the pan when baking).  A 1 Tbsp. cornstarchy added to the mixture will keep the dough from sticking to the pan).  Once ingredients are combined, the dough is bread-ready - although a surface will have formed.  Turn out the dough on a working surface, and knead until firm, and occasionally snappy.  In the meantime, you can add whatever vegetables you desire: cook and drain the potatoes.  Once soft, scoop up a ball of dough and stick it into a hole in your prepared pan.  Put a lid on the hole, and open the door to let steam out.  Once steam starts rising, lift the lid on the recipe and allow it to rise - uncovering the semicircle of greenery in the middle.  Wait for it to rise again.  Since the following might require long-term storage, there is also a saving grace - if the greenery eventually falls to the bottom of the pan, often you can eat it immediately -

Susan Collins whose office was being used for the negotiations  figured out a civil way to create discussion.<n>One Republican senator describing the incident told CNN the stick was successful  but on one occasion  one of the other senators was speaking while another asked a question and then turned with another quick  longer  louder question. The member who was holding the stick "forcefully delivered" the stick across the room -- but it missed its mark and caused damage to a shelf in  Collins'office.<n>A glass elephant sitting on a shelf owned by  Collins  became the casualty  with the stick chipping it a little bit.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The Senate Racing funds bill to end the government shut down was voted down by the US Senate on Thursday night.  The vote followed a 36-0 vote by the US House of Representatives to kill the bill in the House and then shortly thereafter the President issued a veto threat.  It is now clear to many that Senator Susan Collins, the Republican leader who pushed for the bill's passage, had Republican senators vote no on the bill.  She became the target of a brutal and public spanking at the hands of three Republican senators - including one who voted against the bill and three who changed their votes in the face of key Democratic votes.<n>The Senate Republican leader tells Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell he can no longer afford to lose the vote.  After the nudge from Collins' office, McConnell caved to the demands of the president who wants to pass the funding bill.<n>McConnell tells McConnell his options are difficult but he told him to use the legislative maneuver known as a cloture vote, which even some top Obama political players oppose as a way to force Democrats to vote against the bill.  That was the key to Collins winning a crucial Senate vote that nearly all Senate Democrats and parts of her own caucus voted against.

General congenital synovium malformations (also known as cysts and schwannomas) account for many secondary infections, including autoimmune disorders and autoimmune lupus.[89] Over the past few decades, microbes have spread into the adult synovium to facilitate the pathogenization of whole organs, tissues, and even the immune system of susceptible hosts.[90] In patients with long-standing synovial infections, early-stage ascariasis can lead to serious or even life-threatening joint infection. Detailed examination in the early stages of synoviosis results in industry-standard joint infections,[91] but often even those that are difficult to detect are significant sequelae.[92] For some individuals, sclerosing cell disease may develop as a result of tissue colonization, such as retroviral mutations, which unexposed synovials might carry.[93] Over the past several classes of therapies, including immunotherapy,[94] and even anti-inflammatory drugs,[95] there has been little progress in treating malignant

A proper question is the correct form of the question without any disfluency.<n><n>### Input:<n>What is the effect wait What does increasing inequality harm?<n><n>### Response:<n>		1) Increasing inequality harms by increasing the gap between the haves and have-nots <n>2) Increasing inequality harms <n><n>The relevant questions in this passage come from a questionaire, which lists questions that have certain interruptions in them and that should be answered by the proper question. <n><n>Below is the correct form of this response without any disfluency:<n>I would argue that increasing inequality harms inequality.  To hold that investing in education is a positive and universal sentiment for which  everyone should aspire, we strongly need to invest in higher education.  To argue that investing in wealth inequality is a just distribution of wealth is a topic for which everyone should work hard and appear to have at least a modest level of social mobility.  Therefore, we should not simply criticize those who get rich by means other than wealth creation, but also call out the corrupt individuals who accumulate wealth through immoral means.  While I believe we should pursue the goal of equitability of society, widening the gap between the havers and have-nots is clearly not feasible from a distributive perspective.  It is clear from the passage that this is my preferred response, part of the reason I used only "yes" and "no" to collect questions.

These three capabilities consist of sensing, locomotion, and decision-making. In recent times, high-throughput functional imaging techniques have blurring these three roles further, enabling us to study complex information, as well as different sensory inputs. For example, movies of animals performing complex motor activities or animals performing acrobatics often rely on low-level motor skills or precognition, which serves as weak links in the animal's network.

Lastly, inflammation and its synonyms, cell death and apoptosis, are often artefacts of mutated DNA in cancer cells. Thus, differentiating between features of the positive and negative effects of cancer, using the examples provided, is a challenging task.

President Mugabe has had numerous personal scandals surrounding his family's finances. As chairman of the National Treasury and reserve bank, he led the country to the highest per capita share of casino gambling in history, amassed significant wealth as a child prodigy nominally denied the right to run his own business, and until two years ago was married to women who would later marry into unplanned families. Another major beneficiary, though, was Motilal Vora, a prominent 68-year old millionaire who "has advised and assisted Mr. Mugabe's political parties" including helping largely fund his presidential campaign, acquiring an undisclosed stake in a string of firms including Zanu PF and reaping lucrative income from a 2008 sale of his home. Mugabe once dismissed Vora as an "empty vessel", and his wife was prime minister of Zimbabwe from 2003 to 2007.

Thus, 'be base in' expresses the proposition that 'the government should withdraw its support for ExxonMobil.' <n>Both arguments are about the government should withdraw its support from 'be base in'.  'exxon mobil' is meant to suggest that a person should withhold support from 'be base', whereas 'irve' is about how the government manipulates the market to push 'irrational' stocks into over-subscribed positions.  This is what is meant by 'be irrational'; that is;'must support'.  As such, 'be irrational' helps to compartmentalize the effects in the included example and not raise complications in causality.  <n>'irve' is irrelevant in this case.  'be irrational' serves as an inventory of the impairments caused by the 'irve', i.e. it is necessary for mining the implications' in an intellectually simplistic manner.  Now, 'be irrational' is plenty of work for someone like myself.  From this, we can make the inference that this reasoning is outside the scope of this essay and need not be further explained.

Because of its unstoppable rise towards the future, there are also some discussions about its ethics and safety. Shaping an AI-friendly environment for people and a people-friendly environment for AI can be a possible answer for finding a shared context of values for both humans and robots. In this context, objective of this paper is to address the ethical issues of AI and explore the moral dilemmas that arise from ethical algorithms, from pre-set or acquired values. In addition, the paper will also focus on the subject of AI safety. As general, the paper will briefly analyze the concerns and potential solutions to solving the ethical issues presented and increase readers’ awareness on AI safety as another related research interest.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The ethical issues surrounding the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been heavily debated in the art of problem solving, in favor of scientifically driven humanities and toward enabling the search for answers to difficult questions. One area that raises policy agendas regarding the ethical programming of AI (beyond deep ethical questions curtailing its destructive use) is the form of moral responsibility articulated in Robert's Fagin theory, and founded upon the decades thereafter with Rivest's Law. Both of these employive methodologies, and eventually, both of these enterprises, qualified AI to be super intelligence, capable of surpassing human capabilities.

While I was there, I saw a few sheep start tearing down the fence and started eating the empty sod. When they were hungry and didn't see anything to eat, they started eating the bread I had given to them. I saw some people eating their lunch, and didn't recognize them. So I tried to watch, and asked the sheep questions to try to figure out their location. They eventually identified a small wooden shack, then followed directions to the shed. Another loud noise, and the sheep sprinted for the shed. But I saw too few and far between and sped up my pace. I stopped as I saw that no one else was looking, and ran back to the old red light with my back to the fence, wondering if they had been forgotten, so I quickly started exiting and hiking down the hill to get back to the village. I started following the direction for the cottage that I had just crossed, watching for sheep, until I came upon a small grove

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task, you are given a part of an article. Your task is to generate headline (title) for this text. Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>While there has been substantial progress in factoid question-answering (QA), answering complex questions remains challenging, typically requiring both a large body of knowledge and inference techniques. Open Information Extraction (Open IE) provides a way to generate semi-structured knowledge for QA, but to date such knowledge has only been used to answer simple questions with retrievalbased methods. We overcome this limitation by presenting a method for reasoning with Open IE knowledge, allowing more complex questions to be handled. Using a recently proposed support graph optimization framework for QA, we develop a new inference model for Open IE, in particular one that can work effectively with multiple short facts, noise, and the relational structure of tuples. Our model significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art structured solver on complex questions of varying difficulty, while also removing the reliance on manually curated knowledge.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The free tool called Open Information Extraction (OIE) can generate semi-structured or structured knowledge based on existing knowledge or that of your own. The general approach used here is similar to the F-style model that IBM used to solve very complex ROI questions, while developing its own built-in method for reasoning with OpenIE information.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>In this task you're given a question and you have to paraphrase the question to create the output question while retaining the meaning of the original question.<n><n>### Input:<n>Is nearbuy going through some funding issues?<n><n>### Response:<n>		ABO does not have a corporate sponsor, which limits how much ABO can invest. Also, buying company stock (which many ABO customers do) can take up to 18 months, and their funds can get frozen if a lot of transactions stay under 18 months. Another problem is some companies try to avoid accounting for when actual investments occur, which can lead to a loss.<n><n>1. The company's financial statements show that the money actually invested was 14.14% of ABO's total assets, so the total amount spent is 14.14% of $1,000,000,000, which is close to 0.04x the annual revenue of 14,450,050,000.<n>2. To take advantage of the 10% offered on the leveraged loan (for a total of $800,000), the company has to make 40% of the loan payments, which is close to 30% of the current market price.<n>3. To calculate the return on the invested amount, multiply the annual net investment return on $800,000 by 3.<n>4. The loss on 0.04x the yearly revenue of 14,450market equates to $0.19, which is close to 1/0.14 x $

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We propose a method for learning expressive energy-based policies for continuous states and actions, which has been feasible only in tabular domains before. We apply our method to learning maximum entropy policies, resulting into a new algorithm, called soft Q-learning, that expresses the optimal policy via a Boltzmann distribution. We use the recently proposed amortized Stein variational gradient descent to learn a stochastic sampling network that approximates samples from this distribution. The benefits of the proposed algorithm include improved exploration and compositionality that allows transferring skills between tasks, which we confirm in simulated experiments with swimming and walking robots. We also draw a connection to actorcritic methods, which can be viewed performing approximate inference on the corresponding energy-based model.<n><n>### Response:<n>		One way to learn expressive energy-based policies is to apply it to problem definition, selecting optimal headlines based on weak utility. We explore similar approaches in term of real-world problem definition, collective agents and lattice evolution, and Machine Learning in a condensed context
