In this setting, arms may not be comparable, and there may be several (incomparable) optimal arms. We propose an algorithm, UnchainedBandits, that efficiently finds the set of optimal arms of any poset even when pairs of comparable arms cannot be distinguished from pairs of incomparable arms, with a set of minimal assumptions. This algorithm relies on the concept of decoys, which stems from social psychology. For the easier case where the incomparability information may be accessible, we propose a second algorithm, SlicingBandits, which takes advantage of this information and achieves a very significant gain of performance compared to UnchainedBandits. We provide theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluation for both algorithms.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We address the problem of dueling bands defined on partially ordered sets,[1] or posets.

The cluster has been a big help in running my consulting business from my home lab.  It has allowed me to easily process large data sets and scale up my testing plans to include new workloads.  The cluster also hosts a small virtual machine that is used for testing new concepts and scaling up my production workloads.  The greatest benefit of the cluster is its reliability.  It has always been a goal of mine to build a system that will last for many years into the future.  With this in mind, I am happy to pay a little more per share to get a little more reliability as well.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>While there has been substantial progress in factoid question-answering (QA), answering complex questions remains challenging, typically requiring both a large body of knowledge and inference techniques. Open Information Extraction (Open IE) provides a way to generate semi-structured knowledge for QA, but to date such knowledge has only been used to answer simple questions with retrievalbased methods. We overcome this limitation by presenting a method for reasoning with Open IE knowledge, allowing more complex questions to be handled. Using a recently proposed support graph optimization framework for QA, we develop a new inference model for Open IE, in particular one that can work effectively with multiple short facts, noise, and the relational structure of tuples. Our model significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art structured solver on complex questions of varying difficulty, while also removing the reliance on manually curated knowledge.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Here is a method for reasoning with open information extracted from an article.

We apply our method to learning maximum entropy policies, resulting into a new algorithm, called soft Q-learning, that expresses the optimal policy via a Boltzmann distribution. We use the recently proposed amortized Stein variational gradient descent to learn a stochastic sampling network that approximates samples from this distribution. The benefits of the proposed algorithm include improved exploration and compositionality that allows transferring skills between tasks, which we confirm in simulated experiments with swimming and walking robots. We also draw a connection to actorcritic methods, which can be viewed performing approximate inference on the corresponding energy-based model.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We propose a way to learn expressive energy-based policies using only a tabular domain and no other data.

We also show that this method can transfer skills between tasks, which can be verified in the simulated experiments with swimming andwalking robots.

Maternal blood and blood and tissues from non-pregnant adults contained little or no interferon-alpha. Fetal blood, fetal organs, placenta, membranes, amniotic fluid and decidua all contained significant and roughly equivalent amounts ranging from 1.1 to 10 u/ml (or per g of tissue). These findings demonstrate that the fetus and its immediate surroundings are permeated with interferon. It is suggested that this may play a role in regulation of the maternal-fetal graft relation.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The concentration of interferon alpha was measured by a specific anti-inflammatory assay in a variety of liquids and tissues collected during human childbirth. Maternal blood and eye blood from non-pregnants provided little or no interferron-alpha. Placenta, membrane, amniotic fluid, and decidua all had significant and roughly equivalent amounts of interferon. These findings demonstrate that the fetal and its immediate surroundings are sufficiently permeated with interferron to exert a controlling influence on the maternal-fetal bond.
