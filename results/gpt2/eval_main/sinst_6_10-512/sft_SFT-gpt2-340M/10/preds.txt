In this setting, arms may not be comparable, and there may be several (incomparable) optimal arms. We propose an algorithm, UnchainedBandits, that efficiently finds the set of optimal arms of any poset even when pairs of comparable arms cannot be distinguished from pairs of incomparable arms, with a set of minimal assumptions. This algorithm relies on the concept of decoys, which stems from social psychology. For the easier case where the incomparability information may be accessible, we propose a second algorithm, SlicingBandits, which takes advantage of this information and achieves a very significant gain of performance compared to UnchainedBandits. We provide theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluation for both algorithms.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The algorithm we propose is UnchainedBandits.

Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.<n><n>### Instruction:<n>Convert a disfluent question to a proper question. A disfluent question is a question that has some interruptions in it while framing. A proper question is the correct form of the question without any disfluency.<n><n>### Input:<n>What generally dictates, oh no wait, what must local regulations conform to?<n><n>### Response:<n>		There are generally three general guidelines for what a proper question actually requires. First, the question must be framed clearly, that is, clearly stating the nature of the proposed regulation(s), the anticipated impact on the question, and any clarifications you may make. Second, the question must be relatively short; the length should match the number of items that are being asked of the question, and the flow of the question can be easily divided into several smaller questions. For example, instead of fifty-two questions, a proper question might be fifty-three questions with just three short answers. Lastly, the question must have some clear payoff; you cannot ask an answer without at least intimating some feeling of payoff, so a proper question should have some clear reward. The flow of the question can then be analysed to derive the final answer.

Epilepsy is a very distressing experience and can cause great distress for children who cannot control it with medication. To help parents and children learn more about epilepsy, the FDA recently approved a new class of epilepsy drugs called Epilepsy-Rx. These drugs provide a dramatically reduced seizure frequency and dramatically improve seizure management. The benefits are clear; less seizure frequency, better management, and less risk of developing another severe seizure. While seizure management with Epilepsy-RX is still in the experimental stages, a small, single-blind, double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of the two classes is providing promising preliminary evidence.

If one wants to understand what causes a velocity to accelerate, one needs to know only what happens to the velocity as a function of distance over time. Yet, over the past few decades, many people and materials have worked hard to find useful information about acceleration and deceleration, in particular as it pertains to physics, through the techniques of calculus, analysis of ​physics results, and numerical differentiation. These results have three important features: (i) they describe a function over time over a set of measured events, i.e. they are closely linked with something observed in the known world; (ii) they can be calculated directly, allowing one to compute the velocity directly for any given set of measurements; and (iii) their roots are generally determined using established techniques in mechanics, physics, and materials science.<n><n>The three main techniques in calculus and analysis of ​physics yield direct, approximate, and semi-direct estimates of the velocity, sometimes using physical measurements that are known to be close to actual observations, such as the acceleration of the Earth's axial tilt or gravity. These velocity estimates usually remain closely linked with what has been

Consider a simple example involving some random data, say 500 word document (e.g. word cloud), and 500 kilobytes of random data. The figure below shows the typical usage patterns for these files over a few different TCP/IP networks (both public and non-public). It also reflects the interesting fact that many of the file operations actually use a lot of bandwidth, just not as much as you might imagine. Note the usage patterns aren't even close to idealizing the real-world usage. It turns out that the real-world use patterns, while certainly interesting, don't capture the full picture. It turns out that encoding real-world usage patterns in some mysterious resource and then relying on an algorithm to transform them into an acceptable output is really the best approach, even though the real-world usage patterns might not be idealized. In the final example, note the omission of real-world data in the

The sizes of network bandwidths are not variable, they are constant. However, it is possible that some portion of the actual data is wasted due to packet loss. We can assume that this is the case because the material has already been transmitted. Therefore the real size of the network bandwidth is either the sum of the actual size and the fragment size, or -1. This is because the fragment size is larger than the size of the actual network segment.

Much like any other American institution, the American health care system is fragile. In the absence of comprehensive legislation designed to assure universal access to care, California and the fifty other states have stepped up to fill the void. On December 9, 2022, California became the 31st state to join the Program, as per the July 1, 2021, enactment of the United States-Mexico Border Modernization Act. This legislation, approved by the California legislature and signed into law by President Trump on December 11, will make it easier for medical professionals to administer the state's prescription drugs program, will codify longstanding federal privacy protections regarding the medical records of all Californians, and will make it easier to trace the source of many dangerous and potentially life-threatening medications.<n><n>The California legislature's bipartisan approach to addressing the nation’s most prevalent public health issue calls for creating a Title for the Secure Electronic Prescription Liability Modernization Act (SERTLA), which makes it easier to access and treat medication for purposes of public health.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>While there has been substantial progress in factoid question-answering (QA), answering complex questions remains challenging, typically requiring both a large body of knowledge and inference techniques. Open Information Extraction (Open IE) provides a way to generate semi-structured knowledge for QA, but to date such knowledge has only been used to answer simple questions with retrievalbased methods. We overcome this limitation by presenting a method for reasoning with Open IE knowledge, allowing more complex questions to be handled. Using a recently proposed support graph optimization framework for QA, we develop a new inference model for Open IE, in particular one that can work effectively with multiple short facts, noise, and the relational structure of tuples. Our model significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art structured solver on complex questions of varying difficulty, while also removing the reliance on manually curated knowledge.<n><n>### Response:<n>		Your task is to generate headline for this text.

I have high functioning autism idk if that makes a difference but I thought it was worth mentioning. My first and current job (in a bar) is weird in the sense that everyone is dating everyone else.

AITA? <n><n>### Response:<n>		My main text is a post about a complex ethical situation. The main text describes how everyone in the bar is dating everyone else, and jealousy is the obvious root cause.

But the sad thing is, people in the picture probably wouldn't even notice since they're not attracted to the person in the post. So the only thing they can do is copy/paste the text to avoid seeing the jealousy.

Preferred headlines are under fifteen words.<n><n>### Input:<n>We propose a method for learning expressive energy-based policies for continuous states and actions, which has been feasible only in tabular domains before. We apply our method to learning maximum entropy policies, resulting into a new algorithm, called soft Q-learning, that expresses the optimal policy via a Boltzmann distribution. We use the recently proposed amortized Stein variational gradient descent to learn a stochastic sampling network that approximates samples from this distribution. The benefits of the proposed algorithm include improved exploration and compositionality that allows transferring skills between tasks, which we confirm in simulated experiments with swimming and walking robots. We also draw a connection to actorcritic methods, which can be viewed performing approximate inference on the corresponding energy-based model.<n><n>### Response:<n>		We propose a new approach to learn maximum entropy policies using Boltzmann distributions. Our goal is to allow us to explore the optimal policy via an approximation to a sample from a logit-like distribution.

Maternal blood and blood and tissues from non-pregnant adults contained little or no interferon-alpha. Fetal blood, fetal organs, placenta, membranes, amniotic fluid and decidua all contained significant and roughly equivalent amounts ranging from 1.1 to 10 u/ml (or per g of tissue). These findings demonstrate that the fetus and its immediate surroundings are permeated with interferon. It is suggested that this may play a role in regulation of the maternal-fetal graft relation.<n><n>### Response:<n>		The concentration of interferon alpha was measured in a variety of fluids collected during human pregnancy. The results demonstrate that maternal blood and blood and tissues collected from non-pregnants do not contain detectable amounts of interferon alpha. This indicates that the fetus and its vicinity are permeated with interference.
